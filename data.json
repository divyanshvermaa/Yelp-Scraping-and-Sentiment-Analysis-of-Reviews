[["A friend recommended this restaurant and I would have waked right by otherwise. Down a flight of stairs, once you walk in, it's a cozy hub of bustling activity, feeling intimate, warm, and hip all at the same time. We had the Thai chicken wings, gai satay, moo ping, and spring rolls to start. The chicken wings were crispy with just enough sauce and the tamarind came through well - we ordered a second serving immediately after getting the first. We opted to dine family style, sharing the Khao Soi, Massaman curry, and the Chef Nuit Pad Thai. These dishes were all well-executed, with the typical flavours of lime, coconut milk, pepper, peanut, and tamarind balanced appropriately. Serving sizes were also great for a group of four to share and get a taste of everything. Service was quick, considering how incredibly busy it was for a Saturday night. Would certainly recommend making reservations in advance, as this place gets PACKED around dinnertime. Prices are only slightly higher than other Thai restaurants and on-par for the location and quality of food", "Positive"], ["Been here 4 times and each time is absolutely delicious.Taste, portion sizes, beverages, vibe and wide selection are strengths.It's generally always busy, but the place is huge and usually they can find you a spot (if you're just 2).I love to bring friends here", "Positive"], ["Finally got to try Pai after so long! I made reservations two weeks in advance for a weekday birthday dinner for my friend. My friend got the vegan khoa soi and she enjoyed it very much. I ordered the vegetarian pad thai (thai spicy!) ($19) which came with egg and veggies - enoki mushrooms, cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, and leek. It came with a side of peanuts.Giving 4 stars because it was good but I wasn't blown away. I asked for thai spicy and it tasted quite mild to me. The portion size and taste was great. It also came out piping hot! Service was also fast and warm. I would return to try their other dishes- especially their curries. I definitely understand the hype", "Positive"], ["Absolutely worth the hype! Came on Sunday at opening time without a reservation and were seated right away. The decor inside is very welcoming and bright, the music complemented to make a chill vibe. Our waiter informed us they only accept credit card and have a 90 minute table limit. The thai iced tea is delicious - perfect level of sweetness and crushed ice assures it doesn't get watered down. The pad see ew was flavorful and had a great ratio of noodle to greens to shrimp. The hot chili flakes on the side was a nice addition with a squeeze of lemon. Portion size was large. Pad thai was also excellent! The service is fast and attentive. Best restaurant experience I've had in Toronto so far", "Positive"], ["You would never find this, if it wasn't so well recommended. \u00a0Lining up down the stairs, I thought we would be waiting forever. \u00a0But once we made it down, they took us in right away and proceeded to take us through this awesome grey bricked underground that opened up into what became a huge restaurant. \u00a0The vibe is cool, from the atmosphere to the music to the great staff. \u00a0Never mind the incredible northern Thai cuisine. \u00a0Thai food like this doesn't appear often. \u00a0Don't miss out", "Positive"], ["I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a long time to see what all the fuss was about. and\u00a0WOW! The food was delicious. I ordered the green curry while my friends ordered the khao sai and pad see ew, which I tried all of. But I have to say, the pad see ew was my favourite; I kept stealing some. The hint of lime that comes with the pad see ew was absolutely delicious. Every bite had a flavour explosion from all of the food we ordered.We did, however, order the Thai Ice Tea, which was not my favourite. It was my first time trying it, and I found it to be extremely sweet.The servers were also extremely pleasant, and I was completely blown away by this restaurant. Will undoubtedly return soon", "Positive"], ["It's Pai - you know it's gonna be good! My all time favourite Thai place in Toronto. I will always keep coming back. The only reason I don't come back as often as I'd like is that it's hard to get reservations and it's really popular so I don't want to wait in line most of the time. Make sure to come early if you're doing walk in. My top two favourites are the beef salad (so flavourful) and the pad Thai (so delicious). The pad thai is seasoned so well, I can't eat any other pad thai in Toronto", "Positive"], ["Been wanting to come here for a very long time. This was my time here and I decided to try a bit of everything from the menu. The Khao soi was super flavourful and I love the crispy noodles that comes with it. The peanut sauce that comes with the satay skewered was also very delicious. I decided to splurge and got the lobster pad Thai, which is based on market price and only available on Fridays and Saturdays. On the day that I got it, it was going for $50. To my surprised, the lobster is exceptionally fresh and delicious and a decent size too. I actually think it's worth a try. It was definitely the highlight of the night. 5/5 for the lobster Pad Thai!", "Positive"], ["An authentic experience for some hard to find thai dishes. Reservations recommended but walking also possible with a little wait. The venue is quite big so they can churn out new seatings fast. They have your typical Thai dishes but also some unique dishes that you won't find at other Thai restaurants. The Chiangmai beef noodle soup had an excellent broth but the beef was a little tough. The beef salad was reasonable. The pad krow pow was excellent and they also gave up some fresh peppers to adjust the spicyness to our desired level. Massaman curry hit it out of the park. Pandan cake was fluffy and not too sweet which is what I like. It took a little to get out entree but the waiter did apologize but we had our huge glasses of Sapporo to bud the time. Overall it's a low end 5* just making it pass the 4 mark", "Positive"], ["An easy 4.5 stars. One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand.We sampled the Green Curry, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, Moo Ping, Chicken Wings and Tom Yum soup. I'm not going to go through a play by play. Everything was fantastic and I would put your fate in their hands. Order anything on the menu. You won't be disappointed", "Positive"], ["TLDR: best taco place in Toronto, would eat every day if I could and they had more seating. Every single taco I have had in the city I find myself thinking it is NOT Seven Lives and wishing I trekked there instead or that they were open for longer hoursTaste and Food:Every single item on this menu is delicious. I was surprised by how much seafood or fish they have on the item for the reasonable price of around $5/taco. The fish and seasonal seafood is always extremely fresh. The tortillas are double wrapped to allow the plentiful fish and toppings to withstand your ferocious bites. Some items do sell out throughout the day, so go earlier if you are obsessed with a particular item. I have tried a variety of tacos and have never been disappointed. \u00a0 Atmosphere:A small tiny easily missed spot in Kensington Market, but is a fun spot for sure. There is limited seating usually some standing height ledges and one single 4-6 person table. This is a better spot in the summer when you are comfortable getting your item to go and eating it in a nearby park or find a spot to eat on the street.Wait Time:This place is always PACKED, they do a great job of working through the line quickly, especially because there is so much limited seating most people will grab their items and head out right away to avoid the claustrophobic small space. The staff is really great at working the line without you feeling rushed and the items get made super fast.Cost:In my opinion for the cost, this place cannot be beat. I would easily spend 2-3x the price for the same item. I sometimes wonder if they even make a profit because of how good the item is", "Positive"], ["The kings of tacos in Toronto.Seven Lives has always been a major player in the taco scene in the city, and even after many years, they continue to reign supreme. Most diners go for their fish tacos, but I wanted to see how the meat-based tacos fared. Safe to say that they were exceptional. I tried the pollo asado (chicken) and suadero (beef) tacos. Both were filled with flavour and left me wanting to buy more. They're quite big and two will leave most people satisfied. During busy times (especially in the summer) it can get incredibly busy with super long lineups, so make ample time for yourself before you go. Cheers.Check out @foodpharaoh on Instagram for more food!", "Positive"], ["The best tacos in town!! Amazing selection, so fresh! I stop here every time I go to Kensington. Highly recommend their octopus and shrimp tacos!It's a small shop so there's limited seating. Also expect to see lineups during the summer", "Positive"], ["It's sooooooo good ! I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and I'm so happy I finally got to do so ! These tacos are a bit pricey but for the size and the freshness of the seafood, well worth it. I was sad that I didn't have more stomach space to get more tacos. My bf and I tried two tacos, the one they are known for with smoked fish and shrimp and the octopus one. They were both cooked perfectly and seasoned really well. It does get really messy but that's a minor compared to the major flavor explosion in your mouth. Note this place is pretty tiny with 3 tables for standing and eating. I expect it to be a bit hectic during meal rush hour. Can't wait to come back again !", "Positive"], ["Heard about this place from friends in the area. They recently moved across the street from the normal area. The house special I had with shrimp was to die for. If I lived in Toronto I would be here all the time. Not to mention its next to a smoke shop if you know what I mean. Its about high time there was a combo like this in my life. 10/10 stars if I could. This place should be tried", "Positive"], ["So every time I would look up what to eat in Toronto - this little Taco spot named Seven Lives would always pop up. I knew if I was ever in the area I would have to give this place a shot to try out, and I am so glad I did! This is a small joint, which we almost missed while on the way but were able to find it. Once inside there were people in there trying foods and we ended up trying two tacos. We got the baja fish taco and the octopus taco. I loved the sauce and the taste of the octopus taco - the meat was definitely well grilled. However, the real superstar was the Baja Fish taco. This was perfectly fried and the thin batter was absolutely delicious. Every bite I had was amazing. I would highly recommend one try this place out!", "Positive"], ["MMMM tacos!! And this place does it BIG!They moved locations to a smaller storefront across the street, so we ended up wandering in circles as Google Maps isn't yet updated.We ordered the mushroom and cactus, as well as the carnitas (pork). The carnitas was good - the tortilla was absolutely stuffed to its brim with shredded pork. If you're ever craving for something meaty, this is a top contender. The mushroom and cactus is a vegetarian option but so packed with flavour! It was my first time having cactus - I expected a flat piece of leaf and didn't realize it came shredded and pickled. The taco itself is quite oily, with the caramelized onions and mushrooms, and grilled queso blanco (resembling smoked, meaty halloumi).Overall, a great and satisfying meal!", "Positive"], ["Good Location | Authentic | Quick ServiceI visited Seven Lives pre pandemic so read this review under that lens. Located in Kensington market, this place has really made a name for itself. You know someone who has either been too or knows someone who has gone to Seven Lives. Unfortunately I'm never in this area so this was my first and only time here. I got the shrimp taco and it was fantastic. It came out hot and the shrimp was well cooked. Topped with crema and red cabbage which added the perfect creamy and tangy bite. I appreciated that they had a few \"serve yourself\" salsas on the side. The taco was double shelled which really helped with the eating integrity of the whole experience. I really appreciate the rustic simplicity of the restaurant. Nothing crazy except great quality food. Thinking about it really makes me want to make the trek downtown just for my taco fix", "Positive"], ["Craving Tacos and Seven Lives is usually my go to option. Came here for lunch on a Sunday, I used to come to Seven Lives a long time ago when they were still across the street at their old location. The new spot is a lot bigger but due to the current situation, they don't allow dine in. The vibe and aesthetic is lively. There's a lot of art and deco.For the food, this time I got the Gobernador and Blackened COD. I usually order the Gobernador when I come here. It is a taco with smoked tuna and grilled shrimp. The Blackened COD is, as you guessed it, grilled COD. During this visit, I feel like something is missing and its not as satisfying for me. And for the price (which increased from what I remember), I don't feel like I got value for my buck. To be fair, it's still good but makes me want to explore other options nearby. Will the king for my go-to taco spot be dethroned? Who knows. Overall, I would still recommend this place hands down. But if you're looking for value and to be satisfied, perhaps get 1 taco here and go elsewhere", "Positive"], ["Super fun to try! The tacos were incredibly flavourful (however we picked up our order late and by that time the tortilla was super soggy). We got 6 tacos for a total of around $48. $7 for a single taco is a bit on the pricier side, however it's worth a try at least once (taking 1 star off for the price)Our order:1 gobernador2 baja fish1 Camarones a la diabla1 Blackened ahi1 Carne asada The baja fish was incredibly delicious and probably one of the best tacos I've ever tried. Blackened ahi was not the best as the fish was a bit too sweet for my liking", "Positive"], ["One of the best place in town for me. Food is delicious and good service Especially during spring summer eating in the patio is wonderful", "Positive"], ["This is actually more of a 2.5 stars/5 Came here last week with a couple of friends. We were especially excited to try their torched sushi. So we ordered the shrimp, scallop and salmon oshi. The sushi looks great in terms of presentation. However, I was quite disappointed with the flavour. It was bland and mediocre at best. The shrimp oshi was actually the best one out of all three because it has their signature sauce which helped bring out the flavour more. The pork tonkatsu curry was also very underwhelming. A decent portion of pork on a thick Japanese curry sauce sitting on a bed of rice....and yes I know that's what I ordered but again it just felt like it was something I could have easily put together at home. However, the curry sauce is definitely better than your average grocery store ones! Lastly, I know most places have their two hour seating limit and I totally respect that especially if the restaurant is packed..this didn't seem to be the case. There were still empty tables and there wasn't anyone waiting outside yet they kept coming back asking if we wanted to order dessert, then reminding us of our remaining seating time and then finally just giving us the bill. So we definitely felt the pressure to leave. And I probably won't be back next time", "Positive"], ["+.5 for serviceThis is the original Kinka, way before Izakaya restaurants became cool in the GTA.I went with a few friends in my September visit to Toronto. Kinda sad it took till now for me to finally try this place, as I've tried most of the other Kinka branches in the GTA already...however it was always busy for the longest time and I didn't feel like waiting 90 minutes for a table.I wasn't too hungry that night so I only had a salmon oshizushi. It's decent, but considering the hype behind this place I may have expected more. It could also be because the izakaya game has stepped up a lot in recent years, and this place is starting to lag behind a bit. Perhaps I needed to try more items to get a better sense of what the strengths are for this Kinka branch. I can see myself returning as I have a couple friends who work nearby and this is a popular meetup spot by them", "Positive"], ["Hadn't been here for probably 6 years? So i was looking forward to trying it again when my friend suggested it, but it wasn't as great as I remembered. Probably around a 3.5 for the food. A few of the things we tried to order on the menu, were unavailable that night (or sold out). Some of the things we did get really weren't that great. Both the karaage and calamari arrived cold. The calamari actually tasted like cold and soggy sweet and sour pork? \u00a0The tartares/oysters were okay. The udon and the bibimbap were really good though, our favourites for the night. Service was very friendly, and the atmosphere is always great. Portions are definitely meant to be small as it's tapas style--but for the taste, frankly i'm not sure if its worth it for me to come back", "Positive"], ["Went to have dinner after work with coworkers and we had a great time. Everything was easily shareable and we could try some of everything. We ordered tokyo fries, some torched sushi, bibimbap, carbonara udon and tonkatsu with rice. We enjoyed everything and would definitely come back to try other things on the menu", "Positive"], ["Have been here multiple times and the food is always consistently good! Go to items are baked oyster, kimchi udon, mushroom cheese bimbimbap, beef tataki, kaarage, and torched sushi!", "Positive"], ["Dropped in on my first time in Toronto. Definitely recommend you do the same. The ramen is extremely flavorful, the chicken was as well. In addition to being near-perfect consistency, it had great flavors to contrast the ramen. The drinks are also great, as is the service", "Positive"], ["Wow this place is still around! I remember trying them in my college days and I kept trying to mentally add up the bill in my head because I was too broke as a student to splurge. Their food is still amazing! Yes the portions are small because it's like tapas but the quality of the food is so good! We got some super fresh salmon and mackerel sushi, crispy fried shrimp with mayo and an udon dish to share. It's a great spot to hang with friends since izakayas are a bit louder and no grimey sticky tables here!", "Positive"], ["Came here for late night snacks. Had tako wasabi, sashimi and soup udon. Same as other Kinkas, service was nice.By the way I felt bad about broken their POS machine, hope they've fixed it by now", "Positive"], ["Had a fantastic experience in terms of both food and service. Here's what we got: * Salmon Oshizushi (Torched Salmon Sushi) * Saba Oshizushi (Torched Mackerel sushi) * Spicy Maguro (Tuna Tartare)* Salmon Tataki (Salmon Sashimi) * Ikapiri (Calamari ) * Ebimayo (Prawn ) * Karaage (Fried Chicken ) * Lychee Mojito \u00a0Everything we got was super yummy \u00a0but the salmon sashimi , tuna tartare and calamari stood out to us the most! Will definitely be coming back for more", "Positive"], ["Always hits the spot - savoury and flavourful Kim chi fries and grilled pork banh mi are my go tos", "Positive"], ["As more modern taken on Bahn Mi sandwiches go, this place does up the flavour right and the sides like the kimxchi fries or tofu fries are packed with toppings and sauces to overload the flavour senses as well. \u00a0Their take on tacos and baos bring in the cross mix of texture and flavours with the crunch or pillowy baos. \u00a0If you arent looking for a traditional vietnamese sandwich this place wont disappoint", "Positive"], ["We ordered the kalbi beef banh mi and club steamed bao. The kalbi beef was super dry and the bun was very hard to chew. It was so dry to the point where I couldn't even finish the banh mi. The club steamed bao was pretty good as the chicken was super juicy", "Positive"], ["Really delicious! The pork belly bao was amazing and juicy. The banh mi was great as well, but I wish it had more inside it", "Positive"], ["I always come back for the Kimchi fries. The kimchi, \u00a0pork belly and special dressing they use is amazing. Once you have that you don't need to eat for the rest of the day!", "Positive"], ["Not sure if this is a one off thing but I always enjoyed Banh Mi Boys. But can't say the same thing when I went today.Ordered 3 Steamed Baos - Five Spice Pork Belly/Fried Chicken & Braised Beef. Both Pork Belly and Beef were dry af and the pork has a weird taste. \u00a0The fried chicken was already soggy when I went home. Considering my place is just less than 5 mins from BMB, this shouldn't have caused the sogginess but rather how they wrap the food tightly.Overall I didn't really enjoyed the Baos and would think twice before coming back here again", "Positive"], ["Banh Mi Boys has always been a treat when coming down to the city. While the prices are on the higher end of banh mi, the amount of filling and fresh produce used is worth splurging from time to time. The flavours are bold and well balanced, and each component of the banh mi works well in there. The sauces are a nice addition and completes the sandwich as a whole. Overall worth coming from time to time, and a great meal on the go as well", "Positive"], ["This is definitely the place to go for a great Banh Mi. If you've never had banh mi before you must try it!! This place has amazing flavour and greatPrices. The sandwiches are packed with delicious fresh herbs and pickled veggies making the sandwich fresh and savoury.This is a must try!!", "Positive"], ["This place is so awesome. I love that they've taken tacos and baos and elevated it with tastier fillings. Every time I'm downtown this is my go to fast food spot. I love and would recommend the squid taco, kalbi taco and the pork belly bao. It's a pretty casual place with some seats so I'd recommend this spot for just a quick and easy meal", "Positive"], ["First time trying banh mi boys and won't be the last time for sure. I got the lemongrass tofu banh mi and my partner got the five spice pork banh mi. We also shared the spicy chicken bao which was really amazing. We asked that they make everything spicy and they added jalapenos. All our food was fresh, flavorful and really good. The bread was really good quality and was crunchy after we got back our food home. The sandwiches are pretty huge! My tofu banh mi really treated my senses - the lemongrass scent was as amazing to taste as it was to taste. The food is extremely affordable - all that food for about $20 is really great for a Toronto place! The store itself felt small and it looked like it was mostly for take out. Overall, a happy customer and will be back for good quality and delicious food!", "Positive"], ["Must Try: Duck Liver Pate, Scallop Crudo, Duo Duck, Stn BurgerRating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness Experience: One of the best restaurants in Toronto for delicious comfort food. Their menu rotates from time to time, but the small menu offers enough variety that everyone will find something they will love. I've always wanted to try their Chef's Prix Fix menu, but they require the whole table order it, so we often opt to order off the menu so that we can try new and different things. The appetizers are the real stars here, as they are unique in both flavour and presentation. We absolutely love the scallop crudo and the duck liver pate as they are very fresh and have a special distinct flavour. Their mains are fantastic, though a bit more regular than the offerings of their appetizers.Whether coming to celebrate something special or just looking for a nice delicious meal, Richmond Station definitely delivers!", "Positive"], ["5/5 Richmond station is one of my Top 10 favourite restaurants in Toronto. They have the best ingredient and excellent hospitality. Every dish has its unique flavours and is presented very beautifully! Each week their chefs curate a unique Multi-Course Menu. \u00a0It's such a perfect way to experience Richmond Station. I have tried their chef menu a few times and every time was great! They also offer beverage pairings for Chef's menu. It's a good deal! If you love drinking, you should go for it! \u203cThe unique thing about Richmond Station is that they are a Hospitality Included restaurant! \u00a0That means the prices we see in the menu include the cost of service!!! Isn't it a great idea? \u00a0So, We don't have to think about how much we have to leave tips for the service and we know exactly how much we have to pay for the meal. Besides, their employees get paid well and don't have to rely on the tips to survive! \u00a0If you plan to visit, I would recommend you make a reservation ahead of time, especially when you have a party of over six people! Highly Recommend!", "Positive"], ["Actually the food is very yummy. We ordered 4 dishes - beef tartare, duck liver plate, duo duck, and station burger! The duo duck is my favourite, and my boyfriend love both the appetizers! The service is pretty good, our server is very nice. They also gave us a \"happy birthday\" plate for my bf! The only thing is it is a bit crowded, and the servers kept kicking my chair \u00a0but it makes me feel like the pre-COVID time! it is also hospitality included, and all together under $120!

So here I am, it's lunchtime and the other half of that burger and fries is sitting in my fridge. I talk myself out of having the burger for lunch - forget the fact that it'll make me tired in the afternoon, I'm not even craving it. The idea of having to finish that burger feels like a chore. Like \"ugh, I gotta do laundry, vacuum, and finish that richmond station burger today\". I guess that's not exactly what the chef intended when he crafted that burger, but hey - it was hyped to me as one of the best burgers in toronto, which I do not understand at all. The food was surprisingly bland; the burger felt under seasoned. The burger had garlic aioli, some iceberg lettuce, a \"beet chutney\" which had no spice and tasted like boiled beet water, and it was only when I added my truffle hot sauce the next day I actually enjoyed it. Now these guys are obviously able to cook things scientifically; to the perfect temperature and texture etc. But the flavours? Just average, nothing that will blow you away. We tried the burger, scallop crudo, and beef tartare and the only items I thought were excellent were the fries / chips. Sure, these guys can really fry up some potatoes, but otherwise it felt like this restaurant lacked any real strong character or identity, which sucks because i had such high hopes for it. The cocktail (an old fashioned with tequila - meh), glass of wine, and non-potato items I had here just gave me feelings of being let down at every first bite. Maybe one day I'll be back and they'll prove me wrong", "Positive"], ["Great food and nice staff. 5 stars", "Positive"], ["Have always heard great things about Richmond station over the years and I finally made a visit this week. We made reservations for dinner and there is an option to do a la carte or the tasting menu. We opted for a la carte and I tried the Organic Chicken Ballotine. The dish was super nicely plated and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I loved the hollandaise sauce, so delish!!! \u00a0 I was also enjoyed the mushrooms \u00a0and gnocchi to compliment the chicken. The service was good and the restaurant ambiance makes it a great place for dinner! Interesting note as well is the dishes include consideration of gratuity, etc so no need to tip on top. Dishes were a bit pricier but I felt that the ingredients were perfectly curated and worth the splurge! I can't wait to come back and try the tasting menu", "Positive"], ["Great dining experience. We ordered the liver parfait which was decadent and flavourful and scallop crudo which was buttery and sweet. The halibut was a bit dry however the chanterelle chicken sauce they poured over it was really delicious and the charred lettuce was a good compliment to the dish. The burger is one of the best in the city cooked med rare. The servers are very attentive and overall a great dining experience", "Positive"], ["I don't know how Richmond station is still doing it but they are still perfect even as takeout.I ordered a variety of things from here for my birthday and was blown away how delicious everything was.There charcuterie board and cheese boards were still delightful and had such a good variety of flavors. I also really liked everything that accompanied it.The duck liver mousse was so smooth and satiny And the scallops and curry with cauliflower were cooked perfectly somehow and the curry was flavourful without being overpowering.The cavatelli with a hen of the woods mushrooms was fabulous. This was probably my favourite part of this specific meal.They also were doing beautiful bottle cocktails I got the milk punch. If you've never had milk punch I highly suggest you try it. It sounds really strange but they are such delicious cocktails and I love how they're clear yet have a certain roundness to them on account of the milk. I highly suggest checking out a YouTube video of how a milk punch cocktail is made. It's really interesting", "Positive"], ["Definitely the best place in town for a fancy-ass burger that's medium rare. If you hate burgers this place will turn you. It's like you're eating steak tartare as a patty that sinks under your teeth and melts in your mouth. The station burger is the standout... other dishes are hit or miss", "Positive"], ["Delicious food (love the Station Burger) and excellent service (from the front of the house to the wait staff). One of my favourite places to come for a meal", "Positive"], ["I've heard of this restaurant a number of times and finally decided to give it a try with my partner as soon as restaurants opened up.We went on a weekday for dinner. Just FYI, there's no flashy sign or anything for their entrance - it goes with their classy/elegant vibe but it was certainly difficult to spot at night.Everything here is meant to be shared. We ordered the Turkish Manti dumplings, black truffle and cheese pide and sweet jeweled rice to share.The Turkish Manti dumplings were hands down my favourite. It was the perfect mix of eggplants, yogurt sauce and date molasses in a sizzling hot pan. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again! Both the pide and rice were also really flavorful and delicious. The pide reminded me of a chicken ceasar pizza (lol) while the rice had a light fruity crunch.I think ordering 4-5 dishes to share amongst two people would have been perfect. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're around the area!", "Positive"], ["Overall was a fantastic time. The food at Byblos does not fail to disappoint. Would classify it as \"a hearty Mediterranean experience\". Out of everything we ordered, would highly recommend : the truffle pide, the glazed carrots, the turkish manti dumplings (no meat in these!), and the cape d'or salmon. Such a savory variety that you just can't go wrong with really anything you select. In regards to location: the Uptown location is the winner. It has a more traditional Mediterranean ambiance. Downtown Byblos is further away and a bit more edgy. One thing to keep in mind: they DO NOT validate parking. They say to call in advance to provide your license plate number if parking in the ImPark lot at 211 Adelaide street. We called 30 minutes prior to our reservation and there was no reply- just a song playing for 2 minutes with what seemed to be no end. Apparently emailing them instead is the way to go", "Positive"], ["This is an upscale middle eastern restaurant. The food is good, definitely on the pricey side.It is a place I'd probably come once, maybe twice because for some reason, for me, the food feels boring after that - not worth the $$$ to spend on it again. I wish the dishes were more creative and unique. Just feels pretty standards right now..Meh", "Positive"], ["Came here last week on our first date night of 2022, just before restaurants were going to close down once again.Upon entering, we loved the ambiance of the place and the waiter/waitress was pleasant throughout. I also loved the fact that all of the second floor seating had booths/couches which created a somewhat intimate experience.Disclaimer: I don't go out to eat a lot of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food so I can't speak of how authentic the place is, although I have heard that it was quite authentic.Beef Tartare: 5/5There were nice chunky bits of beef with an amazing combination of spices that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The pickled chili did have a great kick but it would be nice if it was less vinegar-y in my opinion.Roasted Red Beets: 3.25/5Now, don't get me wrong. The Roasted Red Beets were very good. I'm not a big fan of beets but I would eat these beets any day. The olive oil tasted really good, and the labneh was nice. The reason why I rate it a 3.5 was because of the Barbari bread that accompanied it. It was very hard on the outside, and dry on the inside. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that since it was our first time trying Barbari bread but after looking it up online, it doesn't seem like it was supposed to be like that. It almost tasted as if they got it from the freezer before they put it in the oven. I also felt like it was pricey considering that if I paid $3 more, I can get beef tartare or manti dumplings.Lamb Ribs: 5/5The lamb was so tender with an amazing flavor. You can tell that it was marinated well and cooked perfectly.Turkish Manti Dumplings: 5/5Amazing dumplings accompanied by an amazing gravy/sauceShort Rib Kebab: 5/5The dish came very thinly sliced, and it was super tender and juicy. It came with a nice hint of truffle as we ate more of it. There were so many other great dishes but this may have been the highlight of the dinner.Black Truffle Rice: 3.5/5Where's the truffle? We tasted no truffle. Not even a hint of it. The rice itself was nicely seasoned with some crispy onions to add a little taste and texture but we were a bit let down by it.Turkish Coffee: 3.25/5It came with the cezve pot which created an authentic feel to the whole experience but the coffee did not taste good. I've had better ones elsewhere.We've also ordered The Geographer and Nightingale Sour which looked very pretty and tasty but I know nothing about alcohol/cocktails so I can't really rate it. lol", "Positive"], ["still a solid 4 stars a few years later. The food continues to be fantastic and I really wanted to give a 5 star but a few things threw the experience off. The good: food continues to be spot on. fried eggplant is a MUST order and the braised rib kabob lived up to all the other reviews. the turkish dumplings are rich and great for dipping bread. The roast beet is a nice light appetizer. Truffle rice has a good truffle flavour and lots of mushroom to add a nice texture.All packed with flavour.The not so good: The truffle pide was literally expensive cheesy bread... there was no truffle flavour and it was served lukewarm. Didn't enjoy this at all and would not recommend ordering this.The service seemed a little scarce...likely due to the pandemic labour shortage and lots of new staff as well as not enough staff. We're normally not very picky but I think the entire floor had only 2 or 3 servers.The missing lamb shoulder: we tried ordering this (as well as the tables beside us) but were told they only had large portions costing $200... huge disappointment especially since lamb shoulder could be carved apart...Inflation: Lots of dishes have experienced a pretty significant price hike (especially when I compare to my review 3 years ago!). Probably to make up for the increases in labor/food costs and the losses from the pandemic closures. Most dishes that were previously $14 are now $20+. Expect to spend about $100 per person depending on what you order & appetite. Definitely a nice place to eat with a cozy atmosphere", "Positive"], ["Food 4.5/5.0Service 4.0/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 4.0/5.0Overall 4.5/5.0Very nice spot in the Entertainment District.

Lots of vegetarian options. One criticism - don't seat the first four groups eating dinner all right beside each other near the restaurant entrance. The fourth couple asked to move, and got moved, so I know the other tables weren't all reserved", "Positive"], ["So I want to say that I wanted to love Byblos as much as everyone else. I was really excited to try this place out. The service was great. Our server was very attentive. I deducted one star for the expensive price for what the taste & portion size was and another for the ambiance of the patio. The patio did not have much decor in the sense that it made you feel like you were elsewhere rather than a side walk. I expected more from this higher end restaurant. Favourite dishes of the night:-Black truffle Pide: flat bread with truffle cream. Can't go wrong with truffle. -Short rib kebab: it's sort of like char siu (Chinese bbq pork) but so tender and melts in your mouth. Dishes that coasted in the middle:-Duck Kibbeh: okay flavour. Nothing mind blowing. Nothing new. Pretty expensive for only 4 pieces. -Lamb Ribs: I found this to have little meat on it and not really tender.Would not order again:-Middle eastern fried chicken: it's like a better quality version of KFC or Popeyes but severely lacked in flavour.-Mocktails: rose's shadow (bland berry-lemon soda), Mediterranean mule (it's like Coca Cola with a lemon as my friend described it)", "Positive"], ["What a great celebration we had at this restaurant.

I've ordered scoops of ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, and pint of ice cream. \u00a0If you're on the fence with what to get here's my recommendation.Scoop - I would go with ice creams that have things mixed into it such as GOLDEN OREO my favourite so far.Sandwich - I like flavours that don't have things mixed into them because I think there's too much going on if you have the cookie AND the ice cream flavours trying to get your attention. I like LONDON FOG for sandwiches.Pint - really depends on how you serving it, I always get a pint of Golden Oreo when I come by because it's just so good.What I had this time:[ Campfire Marshmellow ] This one leans more towards the sweeter side. \u00a0Delicious... Taste just like s'mores if it was ice cream.

Bang Bang is exactly that. A 10-15 person strong line will take about 20 minutes in our experience but during that time you get a chance to scroll their digital menu and go through several stages of FOMO. We ordered the Cinnamon Bread Pudding and it was like eating a cinnabon cloud with creamy ice cream.

Absolutely insane. So after 3-4 years of pent up hype I really had high expectations of this place. How can their ice cream be THAT good that the hype never died down for this place? So finally, this summer I planned a trip downtown Toronto so that I would go when the Bang Bang would have JUST opened - YET THERE WAS STILL A LINE UP! Incredible.But I can finally say I tried their ice cream and the one flavour that truly stood out and confirmed to me that this place could not only talk the talk but walk the walk was their London Fog. 100% would come back and would recommend", "Positive"], ["The family's favourite ice cream \u00a0shop! \u00a0It is so good, lineups are there on a daily, but it is worth it! \u00a0 Good selection of flavours!!", "Positive"], ["A Toronto staple!

After picking up an ice cream cone and a couple cookies we had to turn around, go back and stand in line again to take some home with us", "Positive"], ["Summertime is here! Regardless if it's summer or winter, there is always a line at Bang Bang Ice Cream. There's not only alot of choices in flavours, but there's also choices that you can have to go along with your ice cream Witt profiteroles, cookies, sugar cone, cinnabuns, and more ... Always a hard decision. But I can honestly tell you, you can't go wrong with any flavours that you choose, cause all of it tastes equally delicious. If you intend to get the egg waffle with ice cream combination, be prepared to wait even longer, since it takes a longer time to make the egg waffle. Nothing beats ice cream, especially when summer is around and here!", "Positive"], ["The ice cream is SO GOOD! I visit Toronto at least 3-4 times a year since my in-laws are here and we discovered this ice cream spot recently while exploring downtown and it was absolutely fantastic! The lines can get pretty long so just beware - carve out a 15 minute wait minimum if you go during peak hours.

The fish broth came in a stone bowl (the stone bowl was heated earlier in order to keep the broth warm for a prolonged period of time) the taste of the fish broth was marvellous! I could hardly resist from taken sips even after I was full. The noodle was on the thick side and was placed on a separate plate with chashu, bamboo shoots, scallions and two halves of the marinated eggs. The noodles were cold and was meant to dip into the hot broth in the stone bowl before eating. The noodles were so chewy and the marinated eggs were so tasty! The whole set was extraordinary delicious!!!Roasted Garlic RamenThe broth was less concentrated compared to the fish broth of the Tsukemen and yet I could tasted the garlic flavour in the broth. The noodles were thinner compared to the noodles of Tsukemen. It still tasted awesome! Besides noodles, there were two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and half of an egg in the bowl! Both noodles paired well with the beer!!! Please start another location in uptown please!!!!!", "Positive"], ["Maybe my favourite ramen? I haven't had them all though but nothing has compared in all my ramen eating years. I usually get the tsukimen or roasted garlic. I just love the concentrated powerful soup broth. They also use different noodles for the tsukimen. Extra thick so the soup really clings on when you dip it. I once came with a friend who didn't like green onions so they asked if I would like his on the side. No place has ever asked me that before. Pretty interesting. Definitely worth the hype. Lunch hours are always super busy though so be prepared", "Positive"], ["Can anything warm and satisfy quite like a large bowl of noodle soup? Tasty bowls of ramen with all the flavour and topping options that your heart desires. If you're a fan of spicy food and brave enough to try it, get a side order of their spicy paste.

My husband and I both finished our entire bowls and were very impressed with how amazing our vegan ramen tasted.The restaurant gets very busy in the evenings and it's definitely on the smaller side. We were seated near the back of the restaurant and it felt very cramped. I'm not sure how we would have fit appetizers and drinks if we had ordered them, since the table was that small.

We ran late to find parking (there's a Marshalls/Food Basics underground parking that is relatively close by).We arrived at 8:10pm and saw a long line of others waiting. When we went in to see where we were in line, they told us that we were next, and they were preparing the table for us and could wait inside vs. the cold November outdoors.I'm pretty sure that we ordered, ate, and paid before a larger party of 5-6, who was waiting outside when we first arrived, was seated.Ordered items in my photos.

It was super busy, and because we did a walk-in, we had to wait a while. I ended up getting the Three Flavours Pad Thai ($17.50). Although it does not look like much, it is actually quite a bit of food! The flavour was good, but my personal opinion is that I have had better Thai food downtown. I also would have preferred a bigger alcohol selection, as the other Thai places offer better selections.AMBIANCE | I love the interior of Khao San Road! I love the tiled walls, and the tables were appropriately spaced out, unlike other places that disregard the rules for social distancing.SERVICE | Service was on the slower side. Understandable because it was a larger crowd, but I think restaurants should be prepared for this traffic by bringing more employees in.VERDICT | I would recommend other Thai places downtown... I personally prefer SukhoThai and Pai!", "Positive"], ["We've been waiting to try this new Thai restaurant for a while. Great atmosphere and delicious food. Good thing this restaurant was only 10 minute walk from Rogers centre.Every dish had a distinct aromatic flavour especially the steak salad. The use of mint, coriander, parsley, lime juice made this dish a symphony of flavours. Green curry had an amazing coconut creme broth which I was able consume it like a soup. We asked for medium spice but it still packed \u00a0a serious punch. For people sensitive to spice request it to be mild.Three flavours pad thai was by far the best pad thai dish I've had in my life.

This is my intro to tell you that I can't tell you the difference between the khao soi i got here vs the one at Pai. In any case, they were both good!!I got the Khao Soi with beef to-go and it was definitely filling. The noodles came with a slice of lime, and then the soup and crunchy toppings were packed separately. When I first opened the noodles, I felt like it was a small portion. But by the time I finished, I felt like it was the perfect amount - i think the generous soup portion definitely filled me up quite a bit. I also got the garlic chicken which was good. The chicken itself had a seasoning before it was coated in panko which i appreciated. This dish also came with a sweet and sour sauce that I think complemented the dish quite well.Overall, I think this was to par with other thai places i've been to. Is it AMAZING?!?! I'm not sure.

To celebrate the end of a long week, my friend and I came for dinner. We were very excited as we've been to its sister restaurant Tora and were curious as to how different this place would be!The restaurant's interior is simple and elegant. I loved looking at the lights on the ceiling- they were fascinating pieces of art! In some sections, there were large clear plastic dividers to keep diners safe. We ordered:-Salmon oshi sushi (6 pieces) & Aburi oshi sampler (6 pieces)-Miku roll (8 pieces) -Warm matcha valrhona chocolate fondantThe service was excellent from start to finish. A young gentleman was our waiter. After he wrote down our orders, he asked us about our allergies. My friend informed him that she's allergic to shrimp and shellfish. When our orders arrived, the ebi oshi sushi (torched prawn) pieces from the Aburi oshi sampler were on a separate plate- which we really appreciated. Throughout the evening, our waters were always filled, the empty plates were taken away, and he checked in a few times to check that everything was going well.The oshi sushi were our favourite! The rice was well-packed and kept its shape. The torched sushi melted in our mouths, each bite was pure heaven! Miku roll was good- I enjoyed the crunchy texture of the tobiko (flying fish roe) and the smoothness of the Miku sauce blending in with the ingredients in the roll. The matcha fondant was beautiful and delicious! We loved the way the matcha goodness oozed like a lava inside the chocolate fondant. The Japanese whiskey ice cream was quite strong! However, the strong flavour went well with the sweetness of the matcha, thus balancing out the flavours. Highly recommended! Your taste buds will thank you! :) Tips:-Reservation highly recommended-There is a 2 hour dining limit-Sit by the large artwork (blue fishes swimming) for a cozy and quiet vibe, or, sit under the cool ceiling art for a vibrant and lively vibe", "Positive"], ["One can never go wrong with dining at Miku!

It really showcase a lot of dishes on the menu without breaking the bank! 4/5 The waygu short rib udon was also very tasty, the meat was tender and the broth was flavourful. 4/5 The kasen soba, was a bit more disappointing.

It came in three take out bento boxes (pictured below). The first was like a tasting menu of mini dishes. Some appetizer like such as the salmon katsu and pork katsu (too dry for my liking) and sashimi appetizer (refreshing but small slices). It also had two other sections for mains which included 6 pieces of thinly sliced wagyu (omg soooo good especially when reheated a tad bit and added salt hehe) and seasonal veggies (mushrooms and salad), 2 slices of marinated duck (pretty good as well but kinda small), 2 slices of cooked fish, 2 pieces of cooked octopus and daishi vegetables. It was a cute sampler of a variety of things and we enjoyed the mix of cooked meats and sashimi. Fav was definitely the wagyu!! I love the tasty head in the clouds feeling that I get w wagyu! Second box was a sushi box including o-toro, hamachi, madai, and Aburi ebi oshi and aburi salmon oshi. Fav was definitely the aburi ebi oshi which was sweet and tender shrimp and the deep flavoured soft and fatty otoro sushi. I also liked the madai sushi which was sweet and tender as well! I'm happy w their quality even though we got take out! Third box was the green tea opera cake. They looked like delicate cakes but wish it was larger per piece and wish it came with two different types of dessert. Overall impression: I was happy w the variety of food and it had pretty good value. We opted for pick up which saved us 10%!", "Positive"], ["A superb experience at Miku!I love this stuff, even though it hurts my wallet. They have a wide variety of stuff - and even a price fixe menu which I tend to always stick with (they know what's best). I've only ever been to miku at dinner and it's always been a great experience with service - they know each dish, explain it throughly and are more than kind when serving. They really do deserve that $80-100 tip at the end!! The sushi there is always fresh and although sometimes the combo may seem weird, the chefs know what they're doing and the umami and taste just flow on the tongue. If they have wagyu ANYTHING, go for it - the best wagyu I've ever had in my whole life. It's crazy how vivid the taste is. Even the desserts are always spectacular. I love whatever they put together! The best part is that I never feel sickly full after it and although it may look small, it's a lot of food and will keep you content. Expect to drop at least $500+ on one meal though! AKA. do not bring a first date or someone you're casually seeing (make sure you guys are exclusive, or ask for separate checks! Lol)", "Positive"], ["Came here for the Valentine's Day Kaiseki meal - and man, were we blown away! The food was delicious and the service was absolutely outstanding. Our server was so attentive - a specific example is when she noticed that we ripped apart the single black serviette (they only gave us one) so that we could each place our glass on it, and immediately came back with two serviettes, one for each of us.The first course was a trio of three small plates. A white porcelain vase-like structure was brought to the table and promptly disassembled into its three tiers of plates. There was a shrimp and lotus root paste with nori soup - it reminded me heavily of this seaweed wrapped dim sum with shrimp and water chestnuts. The paste was light, bouncy, and shrimpy, but I personally found there to be a bitterness to the seaweed broth.The second plate was an assortment of vegetables, seafood, and duck. The vegetables (carrot and potato) were cut cutely (i.e., flower, butterfly) and simmered in a soy marinade. The carrot was soft and sweet, while the potato retained its crunch - seemed a touch raw. The bamboo shoots were refreshing with no after flavour. The grilled yellowtail was such a surprise! You could taste the salty soy sauce and there was quite a bit of smokiness - the texture was chewy, dense, almost waxy. It resembled a cured fish. Two small firefly squids were placed in a cucumber round. The squid had a touch of wasabi and was extremely juicy and sweet. The sprinkle of sesame seeds on top imparted a nuttiness similar to the Japanese candied seafood snacks. The cured duck was good; there was a healthy thick flab of fat and it was tender but slightly chewy. The overwhelming flavour came from the butter reduction - it was very rich and fragrant.The last plate was a foie gras monaka - chestnut cream, foie gras, and fig jam sandwiched between two thin wafers. Honestly, I would've preferred if there was less of the cream inside. A single bite would cause all the cream to leak out. The monaka reminded me of autumn with the sweet chestnut cream and slight tartness from the fig jam. There was a hint of bitterness from the foie gras, but overall, I found this bite too heavy.Next came the \"sea\" main - a butter poached lobster tail with leek and potato gratin and a lobster korokke. The dish was served on a warm plate and smelled like heavenly lobster bisque. There were three dainty pieces of pickled celery, a great balance for the butter potato. The potato gratin was honestly too rich for me - there was a heavy earthiness from some sort of cheese sauce inside. We ended up eating it with the dark purple sauce (plum sauce?) which helped balance the flavours. The korokke was very crispy on the outside, and astonishingly soft, warm, and creamy within. It was basically like a deep-fried lotus paste. The lobster tail was. to. die. for. It was tender, salty, bouncy - almost as if it were sous-vide and basted in the butter for the perfect amount of time.The \"land\" main followed, a 3oz Australian wagyu striploin. I didn't love the truffle-infused sauces (the truffle parsnip puree, and truffle hollandaise) but the mushrooms - particularly the maitake - stole the show for me. It was ~chef's kiss~! There was a little char from the grill, and it was smoky and umami. The spinach and tomato accompaniments were just okay - I found the spinach overwhelmingly salty, with a slight touch of something fermented and fishy. The confit tomato was soft but it was just... tomato. The wagyu was good! Buttery and tender, with the flavours brought out by the bit of flaked salt.Finally came the sushi. The temaki were adorable - the pickled radish one was a little tangy, the madai had a subtle sweetness and fishiness which was well balanced by the refreshing shiso and tart ume, and the salmon paired with the salted koji added a nice kick. The uni with the exploding ikura was extremely fresh - I personally found uni to be a bit rich at times, but this one was smooth. The shiso, again, helped to lighten the flavours and was critical in assisting my boyfriend in finishing the uni (he didn't like the texture nor the richness). Their signature salmon aburi was great - you could tell it was likely wild pacific salmon given the dark rose colour. I enjoyed the jalapeno which helped cut through the melted cheese on top. The aburi sawara was fishy but simultaneously buttery and melty - I only wish there was a bit more acidity or spice to help balance the flavours. The aburi otoro was fatty, but a little sinewy. The sashimi wagyu, however, stole the show. It was such an explosion of flavour - the thinly cut beef was tender and the horseradish, white chocolate powder, and everything else created fireworks in my mouth.We wrapped up with the raspberry and dark chocolate dessert. There was raspberry foam, dark chocolate cake, ruby chocolate hearts, and a rose white chocolate ice cream scoop. I personally don't love raspberry but found it was great!!", "Positive"], ["I had a fantastic dinner experience at Miku! I ordered:* 2 Miku Signature Sushi Selection * Salmon oshi sushi (torched salmon sushi)* Ebi Fritters (White tiger prawns)* Warm Matcha Valrhona Chocolate Fondant* Green Tea Opera Cake I was blown away by the sushi. The sushi selection platter was extremely fresh and I love how I was able to try a little bit of everything (nigiri, roll and oshi sushi). The hokkaido scallop nigiri, amberjack nigiri and red wave roll stood out to me the most. Also the torched salmon roll literally melted in my mouth! For dessert, I got their 'Warm Matcha Valrhona Chocolate Fondant' which is basically a brownie with matcha lava inside that flows out! Since it was pretty sweet, there was the whisky ice cream on the side to help bring down the sweetness. The second dessert I got was their 'Green Tea Opera' which is a 7 layer cake (takes 3 days to make)! This cake had matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, hazelnut wafer and more. I loved the fresh fruits on the side too! Overall both desserts were fantastic, 10/10! The service was excellent and I would definitely recommend if you're looking for some high end sushi! You can taste the quality difference!", "Positive"], ["I first tried Miku in Vancouver and fell in love, when I found out that Toronto also had a location, I knew I had to try.I have to say, it's not as good as the Vancouver location, also doesn't have the views like Vancouver either.[Ebi Fritters] - These battered prawns, were an amazing appetizer with a delicious creamy sweet aioli.[Salmon Oshi Sushi] - The main reason to visit Miku. These are simple so amazing, I am usually a huge fan of dipping my sushi into soy sauce but these guys do not need any dipping. They just melt in your mouth and it's so fresh and flavourful.[Green Tea Opera] - Not picture, and I also haven't tried the one here in Toronto but the one is vancouver was amazing!Overall, the toronto location is still good, I would still recommend it, but if you're ever in Vancouver I highly highly recommend. you make a trip to MIKU YVR and reserve a seat along the window for the amazing view. Makes for a perfect date night spot or celebration", "Positive"], ["Definitely some of the best sushi in Toronto. The food is on the pricey side, but everything is so flavourful and delicious, and the service is also excellent.We started with the spicy sesame edamame and the tempura calamari. Both were great, I especially loved the calamari which came with a delicious spiced squid ink. For sushi, we ordered all the aburi oshi, which included salmon, prawn and mackerel. The salmon has always been a favourite of mine, but all the aburi is so fresh and just melts in your mouth. Each bite is packed with so much flavour. The prawn also had a delicious zesty lime taste to it. We also tried the red wave roll, which again was so fresh and very tasty. We had a great dining experience here, will definitely be coming back!", "Positive"], ["Domo Arigato! \u00a0For you \"foodies\" out there, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. From the ambience, to the attentive service, to the quality of the food, especially the sushi to the most amazing desserts. I am a dessert person. I was a truly impressed and highly recommend this restaurant. The fish was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. \u00a0I will be trying out their other restaurants in Toronto. it is a little in the higher price point, but it is well worth it", "Positive"], ["The hot honey sauce is da best! Not that the pizzas on their own aren't delicious, but this gives it that extra bump up", "Positive"], ["Pizza was great. Made quickly tasted great and lots of options. Gave one less star because the actual space could've been cleaner/neater.Also pesto garlic cheesy bread is a must try!", "Positive"], ["Only went here once, so take this review with a grain of salt. I'll update when I come here a little bit more to see if I feel the same all throughout.Really enjoyed coming here. Have been seeing so many people go, and was quite skeptical because it is pizza, and I'm not in love with pizza like many people tend to be. The size is good enough for one person to eat. Price is $12 (tax included) \u00a0for 2 topping custom pizza. About $15 for build your own. \u00a0Crust: I love it. It's quite thin if you get the original (default) way of the crust. It's not hard or crunchy, it's just right. I thought it would be hard, meaning that it would hurt my palate, but it wasn't hard at all. It was pretty soft but had structure, and it wasn't soggy. Just right. \u00a0Sauce: You have the choice of a few different sauces that they put on your pizza at the end. Kind of over killed my pizza with BBQ sauce, but it was still good enough. In the beginning when making your pizza, you have the choice of the typical sauces (red classic sauce; alfredo; etc.). \u00a0Toppings: There isn't an insane amount of toppings. For meats there is: meat ball; italian sausage; ground beef (?); pepperoni; ham; and I think one more. Then you have your typical choices of vegetables, and I don't fairly remember if there were any fruits. I feel like there could be more toppings but it's not a huge game changer, it's good enough. \u00a0Service: It's fine. You don't really get a lot of interaction with the employees because it's not a sit in restaurant (not really; it's more like a Chipotle). But they're generally pretty nice. If you're new to the whole place, they'll give you a quick overview of how things work. \u00a0Price: Not super expensive. I would say it's pretty good for what you get. $12 (after tax) for a 2 topping pizza (custom). \u00a0Around $15? For a build your own. I think you would generally go for a build your own. There are other options like premade pizzas that you can also customize. \u00a0Conclusion: I would really enjoy coming to this place again because of the many different options that you can have and different toppings that you can put. The size of the pizza is also not too big so you can easily (at least for me) finish it by yourself.The pricing is also fair imo and it's not like you're eating cardboard. There aren't really much pizza places in Toronto that are 'fast' with their service, so I would definitely recommend going here for if you want to have pizza last minute", "Positive"], ["The pizza here was amazing and the staff were super nice and friendly! The only problem is the line was very long so we ended up waiting for a while. It was totally worth it and I highly recommend this place! I'm definitely going here again sometime. The price wasn't even that bad to. It's more pricy but it's very good and it's downtown so I can't complain", "Positive"], ["The best place to get quick pizza! Everything was awesome and the service was really great", "Positive"], ["This is the first time I went to Blaze Pizza. I'm pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice and attentive. The price was also reasonable. Now the pizza, it was good, nothing exceptional but good. \u00a0The topping were well served and seemed very fresh. The crust was thin and well sauced, which for me is good.All in all, a good experience and I recommend", "Positive"], ["Busy... and service was quite slow... took about 30mins wait time.Pricing is fair... but was not impressed with the pizza... couple of cut slices had no cheese and i felt it over sauced.Knots was good for the price.I did like the finishing add on... drizzle of olive oil or flavor drizzles; pesto etc... to top off the pizzaIf you got the time to wait... its decent enough", "Positive"], ["Not worth $14.64Average pizzaAt best Small line moving real slow One timer, prefer the couple I visited state side", "Positive"], ["Food was good just like &pizza it's nice toppings I came when they had their grand opening nice service then", "Positive"], ["We love blaze Pizza and we've been customers since it's early days in Michigan. That's how we accumulated the flames - their rewards. My husband got an email that his flames are expiring. So we used them by ordering a brownie online and we went to the store to pick them up. We showed that we had an online order in our email as well as our blaze app. The lady behind the counter said it didn't show up in her system but we clearly had an order # for this exact store. Finally, she acted like she was doing us a favour and said \"this time I'll let it go\". What does that mean? We have an order number and just because of a system delay, she treated the customer so badly. Please train your staff to be courteous. Good food is important but bad customer service is what people remember for a long long time", "Positive"], ["Yasu was the first omakase experience I ever had a couple years ago and I was excited to come back and try it again. It is definitely my favourite one in Toronto so far. My top bites from this visit were the shima aji (one of my fave fish) and the anago. I was really surprised the anago tasted so good , usually I find eel just average. The tamago has fish broth in it which isn't how I prefer it but every chef does tamago so differently, it's interesting to see all the variations of the same dish. The quality of the otoro was pretty lackluster though which my partner was sad about because usually it's the star of the show. Other than that, I really enjoyed all the other sushi that were served and would definitely come back again!", "Positive"], ["I always try omakase now when I travel. Of course had to eat at Canada's first omakase sushi bar! This place emphasizes simple and fresh sushi! You get to appreciate the fish itself with some tweaks to enhance the flavor.With all omakase, there's always a few pieces I'm not fond of but I'm okay with that. I've left other omakases feeling hungry but I felt satisfied after completing this meal. $175 per person -normal range for other omakase's I've had but I would say it's on the higher end. Restaurant was clean. Staff were nice. Overall, had a good experience. Definitely worth a try!", "Positive"], ["I had been dying to try omakase for years now and finally got around to it...I had heard excellent things about Yasu and thought THIS is the place to take my omakase virginity.First impressions: small restaurant, very intimate. We sat at the bar so as to get the most out of our omakase experience. It usually is 2hrs but bc of the pandemic and trying to accommodate all reservations our time was reduced to 1.5hrs, which was still okay.One criticism I have is that it was very difficult to hear the chefs bc of the masks (obviously nothing you can do, given the situation, but considering there was a shield and barrier btwn us and them, it would have improved the experience if they had lowered their masks to explain / describe the dish...I found myself constantly saying \"sorry, what is this?\")Other than that, the food was outstanding Super fresh options from all over the world!We paid $155 each and I definitely left feeling satisfied (not over full)I'm excited to try another omakase restaurant to compare this experience to!If you are interested in trying omakase, I definitely suggest coming here but you may need to book a few weeks in advance4/5!", "Positive"], ["Great ambiance when you walk in. Smell of fresh seafood as you step in the door. Overall, 17 courses. The food was extremely fresh, chef was friendly, waitresses were really kind. The introduction at the beginning felt too rehearsed and not natural, but overall it was a great experience. The seafood were from all over the world, Alaska, Japan, Mexico etc. I would come back again, pricing was pretty good considering I converted from USD to CAD. Everything was delicious but nothing stood out to me to be extremely special", "Positive"], ["Yasu has a take home Omakase dinner right now (dine in closed) that is absolutely fresh seafood, this is a great opportunity to try them as usually challenging to book dine in seats! Some of the best sushi in Canada, they ranked within the top 50 of the Canada's best restaurants list in 2020. The nigiri are covered in generous cuts of fish sourced globally, including toro, Hokkaido uni, lobster, etc., highly recommend this was delicious", "Positive"], ["I stopped by Yasu for a birthday celebration because I heard that this was one of the best omakase experiences in Toronto. With the lockdown finally coming to an end, it was the perfect time to check this place out. We made a reservation online for a bar seat, the restaurant only seats around 12 people per sitting at the bar and maybe 4 at a table at the back so reservations are highly recommended.The service from the waiter and the chef was attentive and it was def. a more intimate experience. The only draw back was I wasn't able to hear the chef explain the dishes he was preparing. The mask, coupled with the plastic barrier made it hard to hear. But for some reason I was able to hear the other chef explaining each dish to the couple beside me. So i'm not sure if it was my hearing, or our chef was super soft spoken.Food wise, I thought the omakase was just okay. I haven't gone to a lot of omakase's but maybe the hype got to me and I was a little disappointed. It might also be because we are still living in COVID times so the fish selection is limited with importing restrictions. The whole experience was a little underwhelming for me and some nigiri pieces were very bland tasting. Overall, it was still a nice to try experience with a personal chef preparing the meal in front of you coupled with a nice ambience", "Positive"], ["Another wonderful experience at Yasu!! Although the price went up from the last time that I went but it's totally worth it. Fish is always so fresh and always get something new. This time the new things that I had is a tuna pate, lobster, mini sweet shrimp... I love how they allow me to have less rice I tired to keep it regular amount but I couldn't so I asked half the amount of rice half way. The dessert or the last piece is ways the same tamago. I love how they infuse the rice and the egg so it's nothing like ones u have outside . It's like cake but really eggy haha. To keep it covid preventions they have the front covered with plexiglass and depending on the party size they have dividers to divide you up", "Positive"], ["This was my first Omasake experience, and it was fantastic; I didn't want to leave. The chef and servers were very nice and attentive, and since there are only about 12 seats and two to three chefs, you can bet you'll get a lot of attention.However, I find the taste and quality to be average, but my tastebuds are weird in general; to me, everything from expensive to cheap tastes similar, but the friends I went with said the quality was outstanding. Not to say the food was bad; it was good, but not spectacular.The\u00a0\u00a0uni was delicious; it was my first time trying it, and I can now say that I am officially in love with uni.I would definitely get green tea with it, but based on what I've seen from other customers, sake appears to be a good choice as well.The ice cream/dessert at the end was absolutely delicious; I wished I had asked for another scoop", "Positive"], ["Order their nigiri omakase for take out during Covid. Extremely reasonably priced at (13 pieces) 90$ for take out. I believe their dine in experience easily exceed 120$/person before tax and tips. The ingredients were all super fresh and be it came in a cute packaging. Their online ordering service charges service fees, I would recommend ordering directly via phone instead", "Positive"], ["We thought we were sushi snobs until we got here. Then we realized we needed some more schooling. Eating here was an excellent class. I'll say right up front that my four stars is four stars for this caliber of restaurants. It's some of the best sushi I've ever had, but the bill did shock me just a bit, comparatively. I enjoyed the experience of tasting new saki's with the saki flight, but as someone who doesn't get to drink saki that much, I wanted more and I wanted to choose. I mean, we ubered! But, you don't get that as an option. You could get glasses of wine or beers at any time though. Sitting at the bar was so much fun and we felt like we gained a family--with the chefs and with the other diners. Each couple seemed to get their own chef and ours was young and had some touches of humor. Watching the chefs was like watching Jiro dreams of sushi but like 2 feet in front of you. There was only one piece of sushi I didn't like, to quote the chef, the piece was \"inside fish.\" But, I've got a good story to tell! lol The rest was melt in your mouth little gems of joy. The mackerel (which is often my favorite) was not my favorite. It didn't have that brine I like so much, but maybe this was next level and I didn't even know it? All the rest was (like the uni and tuna rib) divine. No pictures, it was my anniversary so I kept my phone in my bag. This was a night we won't forget and even with a steep bill was well worth it", "Positive"], ["You can never go wrong with ordering the tonkatsu black. You have the option of thick vs thin noodles. I would recommend the thick ones. Hardy and chewy. Super flavourful broth is what matters most. The black garlic is so strong too. \u00a0A little roasted smokiness added and the pork is melty like butter. This a always a strong recommendation for ramen", "Positive"], ["My Fav Ramen Spot in all of GTA, I've been coming to Sansotei for years now. Sansotei's classic menu does not play around!I love the attention to detail each bowl of ramen has, The noodles in certain ramen dish can be labeled as \"thin\" but its completely different based on which broth you choose.The Cha-siu its in its own level. I seriously can't find any Cha-Siu around GTA as tender and flavorful, but yet not greasy and heavy as Sansotei makes it. It's pork belly feels like its been pressure cooked before, and torched at the end. The fat being pressure cooked, it chars differently.The Broths are light, you don't get that fat film at the top. Allowing you to make sure you can taste the light qualities of the egg, and the vegetables.There's not one Ramen on the menu I don't like. It's a wonderful pleasurable experience every time I sit down for a hearty ramen bowl.I hope to see more menu additions in the future", "Positive"], ["My second times at Santosei. Problably one of my favorite ramen place in Toronto.

Fresh tasting and wonderful flavor of the broth and pork belly, so good", "Positive"], ["Not a review of our experience at the restaurant, considering we never made it to being able to eat.As soon as we walked in, we were shooed back out because apparently they have to check your covid vacc outside before you even step in. Then we were made to show our IDs and our vacc proof at the same time because the girl said she had bad memory and needed to check our DOB - never had someone check that before anywhere? Then finally once we were inside, we weren't allowed to sit even though our 3rd party was parking the car and would be in 5 minutes. We left and took our business elsewhere. Understand needing precautions, but this was overboard", "Positive"], ["By far my favorite Ramen in the GTA. This place was one of my first ramen shops I tried when I moved to Toronto and now it's still my favorite ramen shop in Toronto. My go to is the Black Tonkatsu Ramen. It's full of flavour and the pork is tasty. I do admit the ramen is quite salty so be prepared to be thirsty throughout the day. However, it's still very very good and the prices are fair! There is a reason why there is always a waitlist to get into the restaurant", "Positive"], ["Always stop by and the staff are the sweetest! I had one server compliment my outfit the first time I came in to try their ramen. Sometimes they add cute little notes on the lids and always make sure if you want to take out the broth with the noodles or have them mixed in together. The prices aren't as expensive, and the meat is buttery and just melts in your mouth", "Positive"], ["This is my favourite ramen place in the city. The black garlic one is unreal. I have a hard time deciding what to take a bit of next. The noodles are the perfect texture. The egg is always cooked perfectly, the pork MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH and the broth is such a flavour bomb! I just moved closer to them so I can't wait to order them even more!", "Positive"], ["their ramens taste good. but I don't think their dishes are authentic Japanese ramens. \u00a0their food is overprice. \u00a0if you crave for soup noodle, their food would not disappoint you. \u00a0if you want authentic ramen, there are better choices in toronto. \u00a0The restaurant is clean but the space is pretty tight", "Positive"], ["If you know me at all, I am a ramen addict! So when there is one nearby that has good ratings, count me in!Sansotei Ramen was a tad bit of a jaunt from my hotel, but was worth it based on the reviews! Of course, expect the standard small ramen house, communal seating in the middle, but little to no seating outside of that. I could care less, but do not expect to stretch out here and or to have the children strolling around. Another aspect to consider is there is always a line, but they take your name and give you an estimated waiting time, so you can walk around the local neighborhood while you wait.When it comes to menu, very standard Japanese Ramen style menu, apps and ramen! I noticed a Tonkatsu Black, which peeked my interest, but it also helps many suggested it as well. Ramen was fairly quick as expected, which is great. After adding an additional egg, I was ready to go! Rating for it would fall between a 7 and a half and 8 out of 10. While I have had much better, it completely hit the spot on a cold Toronto night along with my green tea. Price wise, do not expect the break the bank here and when it comes to customer service, its quick and polite (Win). Would gladly revisit if I return to Toronto anytime soon", "Positive"], ["Baked Goods: I don't know what it is called... like a biscuit? But my god!!! It was soooo fluffy and the butter.... holy cow! :)Seafood Tower: Ok, I've tried a few in my life time... and this seafood tower had everything I wanted and more! Lobster, Mussels , oysters, giant shrimp, Poke/tuna thing lol I think just ordering the seafood tower alone was enough for two people. Steak : 12oz ribeye and the 18oz bone in striploin...

Nonetheless, fresh and tasty- Oysters - Kuushi... very decently-priced; about $3-4 each. Also very fresh and yummy.  - 600 day aged steak - extremely interesting steak because of the extreme aging. The texture and taste is unique, fermented meat taste (think... \"lap cheong\")- 45 day aged T-bone - nicely cooked cut of meat, very tender! - Sides: Duck fat fries, Mashed potatoes, Beef pasta thing - All of these were bombbbbbb. Absolutely recommend getting these 3. The fries and potatoes are available in half-sizes so you can get more variety heh.The steaks come with 3 different dipping salts and 3 sauces. Our favourite was the salts. Great place for a comfortable, upscale meal without the precociousness. \u00a0Price is definitely up there but definitely worth the treat :)We will absolutely be coming back for steaks!", "Positive"], ["Came here recently for my birthday during the summer and sat on their patio as there was no indoor dining. They have a beautiful patio. \u00a0Food - Everything was great but my favourites were the Caesar salad and take home muffins. I'm pretty sure I periodically dream about their delicious salad. Steaks were good but they were slightly better pre covid and when served inside. No fault of the restaurant, just the circumstances of the environment we're all in. Needless to say the food was all still amazing. Service - Our server was great. She was personable and attentive. The food was already great but she definitely was the cherry on top of a great night at Jacobs", "Positive"], ["Bookings open up 1 month in advance, so we were slowly slowly counting down the days until our reservation. The steak was very good - never had such a crispy sear before! Our server told us that the recommends one steak medium rare and another rare plus, however I found them both medium rare. Still good since we normally get our steaks medium rare. Unfortunately their Caesar salad is no longer made in front of you! They make it in the back and serve it to you. Definitely can't just paying $28 for that now. The potato gratin ($19) was disappointing. It was cheesy but bland? Didn't seem like they put any salt in this dish. Overall, great ambiance, service and steak, but would skip out on the other sides", "Positive"], ["Fantastic steakhouse, best in Canada.

Seemed like I put them out. The food made up for it. Fantastic", "Positive"], ["Foodie here :) Servers friendly and knowledgable, service is attentive! The bestie and I got different types of Wagyu.Cons: Ambience not quite there during covid, everyone is crammed into 1 room during dining. It gets loud! Music also very loud, not quite the calming sit down that we were hoping for. Lots of salt, and while I love salt, maybe a bit too much - hard to stomach after the salad, sides and steak were all loaded up with salt. Would love to see some milder pairing items available on the menu.Pros: the baked goods are great, if they have an in house Baker, I think they need a raise. Not too much sugar, soft and fluffy. So good. The table bread, also very good. Would have left happy with just the table bread. I swear I like steak more than I like bread, but the bread here was just better than the steak", "Positive"], ["*pre covid review*Came here while on vacation for our anniversary in Toronto and it was a very nice meal.

Of course these were pretty pricey but they were definitely worth it. Mushroom Risotto- Honestly this risotto fell short. I am not sure if it just sat out on the plate for too long before they brought it to us but it was not hot or barely even warm. The grains were clumping together and it was not creamy like risotto should be. I also didn't really care for the flavor. A little disappointing. White Cheddar Popovers- Not bad! We like popovers and these were nice and fluffy, crispy on the outside and really tasty. At the end of the meal they brought us these delicious complimentary hand painted caramel chocolates and a muffin for each of us to have later. That worked out because we were heading to Niagara Falls in the morning and had a little snack for breakfast.

The first time we got take out and it was so good that we actually took the time to go to the restaurant in person too. For take out we ordered an insomnia burger, a fried chicken sandwich and the hand cut fries with garlic aioli. The burger was delicious. Perfectly cooked, delicious Canadian chuck beef and basic toppings but done very well with high quality ingredients. The same the can be said for the chicken sandwich. I normally don't like slaw but it was the perfect acidity to cut the fat from the chicken. The fries were also crispy and soft. They did get a little soggy from the drive but the garlic aioli made up for it. When we went in person I got a blush mojito and we just did the epic nachos to share between us. We ended up having to take the rest to go because that thing was massive. My blush mojito was very tasty. The nachos were good but not my favorite nachos ever. They had olives, grilled bell pepper, pico and salsa which aren't my first choice of toppings. My only gripe was the $18.50 for the platter and the additional $7 for meat. I just thought that was a little pricey. I would of rather had less chips, different toppings and not have to pay extra or at least that much extra for meat.

Even with delivery the other night and it was perfectly made, al dente, right temperature. The kale salad on the other hand was very underwhelming. The kale was in large pieces hard to eat, and a few pieces of bacon and cheese for $17???? Not worth it. For that price I wish more care had been taken to make the kale pieces edible as I assume that's what the high price is for", "Positive"], ["My friend had visited this restaurant 4 years ago during her undergrad. For her birthday we wanted to surprise her with a dinner here. The staff were really nice and accommodating as they let us sit for 30 minutes before ordering as we were waiting for my friend and were getting settled when she arrived. We got a mix of pizzas and pastas, all of which tasted so good. My mushroom pasta was delicious, and I tried the pizzas which had really yummy sauce. That to me is the most important part of a pizza and the restaurant really aced it. The one complaint I have though is that when we had asked to split my friend's bill for her birthday, the waiter made a mistake and split her order by 7 instead of 6 people. Instead of re printing the receipts he just added the extra order onto another friends bill. Although it wasn't much of a price difference, this was not very courteous, especially because the friend didn't feel comfortable asking the waiter to reprint. That's just something that should be done without having to asking a restaurant goer if they want to reprint, because it can be uncomfortable to speak upOther than that, we had a pleasant experience!", "Positive"], ["I haven't been to this King West staple in forever and wish I had given it another try sooner!We tried:Burrata: I'm not usually a fan of beets but these were delicious and the sweet and savouriness of the pickled complemented the creamy burrata wellCarpaccio: This was good, however I felt the flavor profiles were a bit flat, I cant put my finger on it!Malfadeal funghi: Literally came for this and it was soooo delish. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the truffle cream was aromatic. I will deff come back for thisCavelo Nero: I found this kale salad to be too tangy and missing extra sweetness to balance out the salt/acidityDiavola: I'm not usually a pizza fan but this was delicious! the tomato pesto, smoked provolone, salami and peppers all worked beautifully together. The first one (pictured) was a bit burnt since its cooked in a wood oven but the second one turned out perfectTiramisu: Not pictured bc we were lazy after all the wine lol but it was surprisingly delicious! The portion was big enough to share and the espresso wasn't too overpoweringPro tip: Did you know they have $1/ounce house red/white wine off the menu?! Crazy cheap price for dine-in and the wine was decent too! The prices are very reasonable, and food is tasty.

Everything was always fresh and delicious, and you can tell that the pasta is made in-house, because the pasta was always a delectable al dente. However, the dish I absolutely adore is the Mafalde Al Funghi. It's a pasta with portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce. This i definitely THE dish to get. During the summer there was also a peach mozarella dish that was also super refreshing and still makes my mouth tingle thinking about it Love how they have some seasonal items to try out.Though it's very obvious that the Gusto 101 ethos and style is very different, I would put Gusto 101 at a similar level to Scaddabush, if not for the funghi pasta, which is why I've deducted half a star from 5 for flavour.Although I am no wine person, it's worth noting that my friends also enjoyed the wine selection available here to pair with your meal :) Place (3.5/5) :The restaurant itself is beautiful, but if only it was brighter for me to admire it! I get it, fancy restaurants are usually dim lit, but this restaurant was particularly dark. They gave us an ambient candle to light up the table, but it was still quite dark. So dark, in fact, that our server kept missing us when we tried to order more or ask for water. Service was great when they could see you! Also notable that if you're going to dine-in, it is an expensive area to park in, if you can find parking on the weekend. Otherwise, this is a great place for dates and friends to hang out for great pasta and a few drinks as well!

The food is amazing and fairly priced. We went around 5:30 on a Thursday and got seated immediately (the website said they don't take reservations so we just walked in). We were seated on the upstairs patio and there was a lot of room, probably due to COVID restrictions as well. For our app, we ordered the calamari fritti. It was amazing and the lemon aioli was delicious. We ate it so fast I forgot to grab a picture of it. For our mains, we ordered the famous truffle mushroom pasta and the Diavola pizza. The mushroom pasta was creamy, cooked perfectly and they did not skimp out on the truffle. \u00a0Although the portion may not look like a lot, it is really filling. The pizza was great as well but the pasta was definitely the star dish. The staff is really nice and service was fast. There are plenty of staff cleaning as well so it felt very COVID safe.

Quality: food was good. \u00a0A bit of a mixed feeling here though. \u00a0I love al dente but Mafalde Ai Funghi were way too under, by a good min or two. \u00a0The truffle sauce was also too heavy. \u00a0The Bolognese was fantastic as was the simple lemon spaghetti. \u00a0The pizza's here are some of the best in the city. \u00a0The Huge issue (hence the 3 stars) was service and quality of the calamari. \u00a0On the former, the staff was not very attentive, and a bit aloof. \u00a0The latter was just flat out bad. \u00a0Either the calamari were frozen and/or were not washed properly as it had bad smell and immediate fishy taste. \u00a0Gusto can probably do better", "Positive"], ["BEST PASTA!

This is the cafe (and the only restaurant) in that alpha lab medical complex. I would highly recommend the chicken panini there for its crunchiness. Latte there is \"cute\" because they made a bear for you : )", "Positive"], ["This cafe tucked away in a medical lab is definitely a hidden secret. I ordered a rose pasta with penne and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna. The penne portion was super generous and could last 2-3 meals. The lasagna portion was very fair. Both dishes were delicious. I really had to mix the penne to get the sauce all around because the first few bites I took without mixing it were kind of dry and bland. I wish I added meat to my penne dish because it felt kind of boring without any other flavours besides the sauce and the noodles. Would come here again and try something else!", "Positive"], ["I don't think I've been here since December 2019 so it has been quite a while, but realized I never reviewed this spot!

Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special.

So some savings is great. They do have a service charge of 18% that is added to the bill already just fyi. The burger is hot, delicious, juicy and something you don't expect to order for an oyster place... But trust, it's a must order. I got the fish and chips. Decent fish and the tartare sauce is divine. The one drawback were the fries. They were very overdone - either old and refried or just left in the oil too long? It didn't look bad. They were thin cut but not sure why it was hard and wasn't the same as previous orders from this place. Our server replaced it and it was better than the ones that came with our dish, but was still a bit overdone. Tbh I think the oil might have been too hot or something was amiss with it. In either case, the service was great and they definitely accommodated us as best as they could. We appreciate it!Currently they have patio dining outside on the parking lot.

My partner was easily convinced into order their signature burger, easy compromise.The food was delicious and well packaged, but for the price, I had to knock off one star. The lobster roll was everything I dreamed of, but for $25 I really expected more than a 4 inch roll with maybe a quarter cup of lobster. The whole thing took me all of 3 bites to eat, in less than 2 minutes. Tasty, but such a disappointment. Many mixed emotions here. On top of that, you have to order a side, but the price of the side is not included in the combo so I had to pay an extra $5 for fries, which was...not great. I'm glad they forced me to order the fries though, because they ended up being the main part of my meal since my lobster roll disappeared in 2 minutes. I was hungry after, and very jealous of my partner's burger, which he enjoyed and was a generous portion (also required to pay extra for a side).I cannot give 5 stars based on how disappointed I was, but I will also not leave a bad review because I believe the in-person dining experience will be much different. I look forward to visiting in person and trying their other menu items and updating my review accordingly", "Positive"], ["Easily my favorite restaurant in Toronto - drinks, food, service were all phenomenal! Drinks were so yummy and mixed very well. We tried 3 of the martinis (lychee, pear, and raspberry) and doubled up a couple times because they were just so dang good! The bartender did not hesitate to share what liquor she used upon inquiry - I ended up purchasing a handle of the Soho lychee liquor when I got back to the states and now use it in everything. I'm struggling to recreate the drink though because white cranberry juice is near impossible to find here.We chose a handful of oysters from their extensive list to create a dozen and by the time we were wrapping up our meal, we realized it was oyster happy hour, so we ordered a dozen more! My happy sentiments about the oysters resonates among all the other seafood items we ordered except for the tandoori cod, which was overpowered by seasoning and seemed to be a strange addition to the menu. The scallops and raw shrimp were excellent though.We ordered the bread pudding to wrap up our meal and the spices were perfect to warm our bellies before heading back out into the cold. Before dessert arrived, I made a trip to the restroom and on the way back up the stairs, I noticed black sesame cake written in chalk on one of the pillars, so obviously we ordered that as well since it's one of my favorite flavors.

I usually don't eat mixed greens but the dressing was yummy and there was nothing bitter in there. Steak was super juicy. Blueberry pancakes 4.5/5- perfectly sweet.

I think it could have been more efficient but not the worst", "Positive"], ["This place is one of the top brunch places to visit in Toronto! Super popular and busy, they do not offer reservations during weekend brunch and it is advise to be there right when they open at 9am. We were a table of four that came here around 9:20am and were told the wait was between 45-50 mins, since we were here already we might as well wait because it was everyone's first time here. Luckily there were a few stores around the neighborhood so the wait wasn't too bad and we were notified via text when the table was ready.Hostess was super friendly and nice, we were seated \u00a0promptly at our table near the window which overlooked the GO train rails. Our waitresses was nice, brought us water to start. There was a bit of a hiccup (Waitress inputted the wrong item and missed my bf's order) which resulted in us getting a full order of blueberry Buttermilk pancakes instead of a side of pancakes (yay for us)We ordered the manhandler which was steak on toast with two sunny side up eggs, side of mixed greens and hp sauce, their famous blueberry buttermilk pancakes, veda's choice which was two poached eggs with a choice of bacon, smoked salmon or avocados on a baked croissant with bearnaise sauce and huevos monty which consisted of black bean refritos and sharp cheddar cheese baked in flour tortillas and topped with two eggs sunny, fresh salsa, avocado smash and sour cream and a side of rosemary roasted potatoes which were crispy and fluffy to eat. Presentation wise was amazingly delicious and mouthwatering to see. I absolutely loved the buttermilk pancakes and we could all agree it was one of the best we've had. Fluffy, not so sweet, whip cream was light and abundance of blueberries to eat. The steak from the manhandler was cooked medium rare but looked more medium, still delicious with the hp sauce. Nothing too special about the veda's choice and huevos but the poached eggs were pretty good. We got some warm scones to go and that was awesome!We definitely want to come back the next time to have their Buttermilk pancakes, there is no free parking but paid indoor parking by the meter so definitely check them out if you ever get a chance to!", "Positive"], ["It was a long wait to get in and no reservations. \u00a0 It took over two hours on family day! \u00a0Once we got in, they told us two of the main items (manhandler and grilled cheese) were sold out which was disappointing. \u00a0Next time.The food, service and ambiance is excellent as usually. \u00a0 Fresh and tasty. \u00a0Just dont be in a big rush. \u00a0 I can't want til they have the reservation system up and running. \u00a0 The waiting to get in and the waiting for food prevented me from giving them five stars", "Positive"], ["I've been thinking about Mildred's blueberry pancakes for a few years.

Show stopping. Out of this world. For real though Mildred's was a great experience!!!The wait time is usually quite long. I arrived at 11 and there was a 1.5 hour wait. However they had seating at the kitchen view which had no wait so I jumped at that! Ordered the eggs Benny and pancakes to share. Food came quite prompt. The eggs Benny with smoked salmon was good - it came in a croissant - but wow the pancakes...these pancakes were incredible. I have not tried pancakes like this ANYWHERE. The blueberry compote with the fresh cream. Mmmmm so good!!!! If there was a wait longer than an hour I'm not sure if I would have stayed, but I'm glad I got to try out Mildred's - it truly was delicious!", "Positive"], ["Their pancakes are amazing! We sat by the kitchen and were able to see the pancakes being made right before our eyes. I would have preferred the syrup on the side; the pancake at the bottom soaked up most of the syrup by the end and it was too sweet for me to want to finish.I'd highly recommend going early - we went in the afternoon (around 1PM on a weekday!!) and if we didn't choose the bar area, we would have had to wait much longer", "Positive"], ["5 star food1 star service first time here after reading the raving reviews - and for the most part, they were true. the blueberry pancakes were phenomenal, which is an understatement. the texture of the pancakes were heavenly, and the berry compote was spot on. i also thoroughly enjoyed the steak and egg special, which came with a barbecue sauce i could drink straight out of a tub. sooo delicious. the eggs were perfectly cooked and complimented the steak well. although the food was incredible, the service, however, was not. we were in there for almost 2 hours, albeit it was busy, but there's no justification for having to wait 2 hours after being seated. this also snowballed me into being late for work. the worst part is, the kitchen being open, we could see our food ready for us, and it was just sitting there, getting cold. the food was lukewarm when it got to the table, but we were so hungry at that point that we let the temperature slide. our waitress was nowhere to be seen for long periods of time, where we had to find and flag her down for water. i wish i could come here again, but after such a conflicting experience (great food, bad service), i will order takeout instead", "Positive"], ["Their duck fat fries are AMAZING!! The sauce that comes with the fries are completely game-changing. Super creamy and savory. I also ordered their Danger Dog, which was filled with the most deliciously melted cheese. Service was also very attentive. They came to check up often to see how I was doing", "Positive"], ["The quest to make German-style sausage and fries into an upscale, hip dining experience is normally one I'd be receptive to. And if I weren't a student and money weren't a concern for me, I wouldn't have minded this as much and I would have been inclined to return to try out some of the weirder offerings (kangaroo, rabbit, etc).But $40 for a sausage (with one or two basic toppings), a plate of curry fries, and a beer was deeply unsatisfying. I was neither full nor tipsy at the end of it.If that isn't a concern for you, then as a space it's very good - I was there with a large group for a party (we reserved), and there were several other large groups there as well", "Positive"], ["Wvrst is A must try staple in the King St area. \u00a0The hand made pretzel was soft and chewy. \u00a0The mustard had an underlying horseradish taste so it was a bit spicy. \u00a0Duck fat fries are greasy but very delicious -- the dipping sauce was heavenly. \u00a0We got the bison sausage and duck sausage. \u00a0I was surprised that neither were gamey at all. \u00a0You can taste the excellent quality of the meats. \u00a0There are other more exotic options such as kangaroo and vegetarian options too. \u00a0A lot of produce and product are locally sourced. \u00a0There is an outdoor patio and indoor seating as well", "Positive"], ["Wow what an interesting dining experience. They have an abundance of interesting and exotic meats from elk to rabbit to kangaroo. If you're feeling adventurous with food this would be a great place to go. I ordered the rabbit dog and the meat was seasoned with tomatoes and other seasonings. The texture is not like the usual hot dog it was definitely more meaty and rough. You can choose two toppings so I chose the jalape\u00f1os and saut\u00e9ed onions. Overall a great dog but I wouldn't order again something worth trying at least once though", "Positive"], ["Note: visit took place pre-COVID.They don't have table service so you whip out a menu at the front and grab a seat wherever (except for the reserved areas) then when you're ready, order at the front and get a number to await your delicious goods. Seating is cafeteria style so get ready to have people close by. It can be pretty loud but the ambience is nice. There's an open concept kitchen and little fairy lights adorning the place. I didn't order any beer but I noticed they also have a good beer selection.The food can take long to arrive if it's really busy. 1 friend got her vegetarian Mediterranean sausage bun 15 mins in but my other friend and I waited over 30 mins for our duck fat fries and sausage buns. I ordered another sausage bun to go to bring home to my partner but they made the mistake to bring all our food at the same time and packed our entire order to go. This was a little upsetting and there wasn't really anything to do about the situation, but it did dampen the experience a bit. The duck fat fries are a little dry for my liking but the flavour is good. The included jalape\u00f1os still have seeds in them so it has a KICK. The standout though was definitely the currywvrust sausage mmmm. Definitely needs more sauce though. I got a kangaroo bun with saukeraut and onions.I'd say the food was fine but I wasn't wowed or anything. I do think the place is worth giving a try for the ambience alone. Cool place to chill after work. :)", "Positive"], ["Lively little joint with good vibes, great beer, and impeccable service. However I just don't think the sausages were flavorful enough, especially the elk sausage had some really chewy sinewy parts. Duck fat fries were a little thicker than your usual fries and a bit greasy, but delicious with the paired chipotle mayo. Overall a good visit but I'm not rushing to return", "Positive"], ["There're more types of sausages here than you can shake a stick at. In the category of game alone you get exotic choices like venison, bison, wild boar, rabbit, kangaroo, elk & guinea hen.I went for Wild Boar. The tea gave it an unusual flavour that worked (if you're up to try wild boar, you probably don't mind tea in your sausage anyway). It wasn't too gamey either. It came with a bun which was a toasted mini baguette, not your normal hot dog bun.I chose to have it with sauerkraut and onion. The sauerkraut was basically boiled cabbage & didn't taste of much. Onion tasted very mild. The bland topping were probably so as not to mask the taste of the sausage.Duck fat fries were fantastic. The animal fat gave them a superior flavour & it was a big portion too.\u00a0They were thick cut & crispy enough (like British chips, but the bite from the duck fat means they were more satisfying than their crispiness would warrant). I chose garlic chive sauce as my dip, which was delicious", "Positive"], ["We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. The staff was extremely friendly and nice, and offered us their advice on drinks and foods! It was our first time trying this spot and we were excited for the cuisine they offer. I ordered the house pretzel (served with hot as ever wasabi mustard) and an extra side dip of boiling hot Gouda cheese (delicious!!). The pretzel was a bit on the dry side, but the cheese dip made it much better. We ordered their signature potato salad, and that was absolutely delicious. Super creamy and packed with flavour! My boyfriend had their burger (the only one they offer), and I had a bite (for the sake of this review). It was great! Juicy and flavourful and cooked just about right. It was on the smaller side though so if you're a big guy you might need some sides. The duck fat fries side was disappointing. They were hard, and almost over cooked with barely any flavour. Again, the truffle mushroom mayonnaise dip we ordered made them better. The green garden salad was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall it was a good experience and the location and their patio seating is really nice. I think if you decide to go there it would be best for you to try their signature sausages. That would be definitely something I would try next time since I didn't have much luck with my pretzel", "Positive"], ["Not the wvrst place for late night comfort food But seriously this place is awesome for friends after a night out on king west or for after work drinks. Seats a lot of people communal style. Can't really go wrong with any of their sausage options or curry wurst", "Positive"], ["Cheese Fondue, Bratwurst, Beer. Do I need to say more? Ontop of that, the atmosphere is very rustic and has a tavern feel to it. I love German food, and this was an exceptional German cuisine experience", "Positive"], ["Stopped by for a snack and my one regret is not being hungry enough to try the soup dumplings. Luckily I got to try the pan fried dumplings and they were phenomenal. Lots of places make these and ends up drying out the soup but there was plenty in these! The crisp on the bottom was perfect and the dough was light and airy. Delicious filling as well - loved this place. FYI - only take out at the moment!", "Positive"], ["Juicy dumpling is the iconic spot that many know for tasty cheap soup dumplings. It's worth every penny and you can't beat the fried soup dumpling buns.

It's cheap bites but great taste for the price!", "Positive"], ["For the price, you probably cannot beat this spot. For what you're paying, the portion size is decent and extremely filling. This place was recommended to us by almost everyone who lived in Toronto. Service is quite fast too, despite a filled storefront. We got the scallion pancakes, wontons in chili oil, xiaolongbao, and Shanghainese pan fried dumplings. I do think they were very delicious, but not as \"authentic\" in the details. Flavor and everything they nailed, but it was the small things that I had more expectation for: - Chili oil in wonton: the chili oil part was a bit lacking in flavor in my opinion, though they nailed the sweetness of this dish - Panfried dumplings: my friend is from Shanghai, and mentioned that he wished the bottom of the bun was more panfried - it almost seemed just like any other steamed bun (though flavor was amazing!) - Scallion pancake: missing just a bit of the crunchy texture Overall though, would definitely be a place to come back to for how good it tastes and the reasonable pricing!", "Positive"], ["I am Taiwanese and xlb are in my top 5 favorite foods of all time. As a result, I've tried A LOT of soup dumplings. These ones....I thought were okay. I came 30min before closing and I had to take my order to go (Juicy dumpling is not doing dine-in right now). This is a disservice to xlb because they are definitely best enjoyed hot and fresh. I will start by saying that the flavor is really good. The pork inside is perfectly steamed and the broth was delicious. The dumpling skin has the perfect thickness - not too much dough but not so thin that the skin will break when being picked up. However, it is possible the xlb did not break because there was barely any soup inside. If you are like me and like to pour out the soup onto a spoon...you're going to have a difficult time getting enough soup out. I also ordered some pan fried items. I don't know if they were affected the steam inside the takeout box, but my pan fried dumplings were not crispy. They were just squishy and oily. The flavor was still good though. A final nail in the coffin: \u00a0no vinegar or ginger. There wasn't even soy sauce. (I asked) My order came with two packets of manufactured hot chili sauce which was just a tragedy to dip soup dumplings in :(I can't complain too much because the dumplings are pretty cheap (for western standards). It is also possible that the dumplings were less fresh right before closing time. I'm honestly shocked that there are so many fantastic reviews. Are Yelpers rating this place based on the quality or the value? The latter is great but the former is...questionable. I will have to come back during the middle of the day to see if my experience improves", "Positive"], ["I finally had the chance to order from juicy dumpling in person after ordering it on Uber eats a couple of years ago! Currently, they have take-out only, but I came in the store with a friend to grab some lunch. We each ordered the steamed mini soup Dumplings and the steamed BBQ pork bun. They were ready within like 3 minutes of placing our order. Both were absolutely DELICIOUS. And the prices of this place are literally insane (so inexpensive)!! We were crazy enough to eat our dumplings in Bellevue park (very close by, about a 5 minute walk away) in -10 degree weather, but by the time we got to the park, the buns were still hot and steaming LOL. I cannot recommend this place enough. You get really good comfort food, fast and friendly service, and amazing prices. What more can you ask for!?", "Positive"], ["These dumplings are delicious, and are what you need on a cold day in Toronto! They are so flavourful and are always served hot and fresh. My only problem is that they increased the price from 2.99 to 3.99. I personally feel like the price increase wasn't necessary. They were perfectly priced before and served as a nice cheap treat. The other concern I have is that there isn't anywhere to sit/stand and enjoy the food. They used to have a stand up bar that people would quickly eat at in the past, but there was caution tape on it. It's difficult to take the soup dumplings and go somewhere else to eat because they get cold and don't taste as good after", "Positive"], ["Had the chance to try Juicy Dumpling - and this place was soooo delicious! This is a small little joint near the Kensington Market Area, I think near the Chinatown section, and my cousin spoke highly of it. I am a huge fan of the steamed pork dumplings, especially when it comes with soup - and these absolutely hit the spot. For $3.99 a pop this came with 6 dumplings - so juicy and absolutely DELICIOUS! I was blown away how tasty this dish was - and would highly recommend others to try it!", "Positive"], ["Pan fried juicy pork buns. Nuff said. Actually, no, there's much more. The dumplings here are amazing. Dumplings are a big deal. All dumplings are not created equal. There are many factors to the perfect dumpling. I know little about these things. What I do know is that I was blown away by their pan fried juicy pork bun. The best I've ever had. When you dedicate your menu to a single category like dumplings, you have a lot to prove. Juicy dumplings are all that. MmmmmMmmmm", "Positive"], ["My husband and I loved their veggie and soup dumplings. My meat eating husband loved the bursting soup dumplings in his mouth. He was excited like a child every time he had one of the dumplings. The price is unbeatable - $2.69 for 6 filling dumplings is a steal. My veggie spinach and mushroom bao buns were pretty great too. I ordered the shitake mushroom bao and was slightly disappointed that it hardly had mushroom and it was mostly spinach. But the bao buns were pretty huge, filling and tasty. I wish they had the hot oil and if they had that, I'd even buy it for an extra dollar. That would make it a killer meal. I can't wait to get them again and have with some store bought hot oil", "Positive"], ["I have been hearing about this place for so long and been wanting to try it for so long. I have always been a huge fan of xlb (xiao long bao steamed pork dumplings).Finally got a chance to stop by the neighborhood today. Ordered two S1 ($2.99 for 6 pork dumplings). There was lots of people there but my order was ready within 5 mins.It's juicy and it's good. The price is affordable. No wonder it's like a neighborhood gem. Will definitely come back for more ", "Positive"], ["Amazing curry chicken and their cheese crabmeat croquette are a must try.The meat/curry servings are enough to fill you up no matter your appetite with great nutrients.Although some may argue the cost of $20 on their main menu items is a lot, its a large serving that constitutes as a whole meal. $20 for a well made and delicious lunch or dinner in the middle of downtown Toronto is completely worth it in my opinion.+ Staff are easygoing and kind", "Positive"], ["Great Katsu place!! Lots of variations and sauces. Katsu is crispy and breading is light. The curry sauce for the original Katsu has a slight sweetness to it and isn't too heavy as a sauce. The red carbonara sauce has heat to it so only order if you can handle a bit of spiciness, there's seafood mixed in the sauce and it's more on the creamy side so it sits a bit heavier. Both katsu dishes came with soup, rice, and cabbage slaw. Portions were huge and you get 10% off if you pick cash", "Positive"], ["As always katsuya is one of my favorite spots to hit up when ever I'm craving for katsu. I'm so glad they opened multiple spots which are super convenient all over the GTA. One of my favorites is the downtown location near Ryerson University. I had ordered take out through ubereats and ordered my all time favorite red carbonara katsu along with 5 pieces of their super popular croquettes and a side of the red carbonara sauce so I could use it to make some red carbonara udon at home another day. They make their bread crumbs in house by starting off with freshly baked bread followed by the other steps to make their bread crumbs. I love how tender the pork loin is, how golden fried the katsu is and how amazingly delicious the red carbonara sauce is! It is a cream sauce base with a kick to it, \u00a0some pieces of seafood can usually be found (i.e shrimp) , bacon, chili flakes l, etc. But it is one of the must get dishes if you like spicy. The set meal comes with shredded cabbage with dressing, soup and a side of rice. The croquettes are coated in their in house bread crumbs followed by a deep fry to achieve a beautiful golden brown color. The mash potatoes and mozzarella cheese filling in the center oozes out and paired with their made in house tarter sauce, it's absolutely superb!P.S - if you order take out or dine in and ask for an extra rice or cabbage it's free of charge!", "Positive"], ["Good katsu place. Katsu has a clean aftertaste and isn't oily which is great. We had the pork loin katsuya original and the Japanese traditional which were both very good. The only difference between them is the sauce. I prefer the katsuya sauce, which tastes smooth, savoury and slightly fruity and goes really well with the pork. Price was a bit steep for extra sauce ($3.75) though. Started getting busy around 6 pm which was when we left. And they have a 10% discount if you pay in cash", "Positive"], ["This was one of the best things I ate in Toronto. Came in for dinner. The place was packed. This spot deff gets busy in the evenings.I went with the Traditional . It's Fried chicken unlike any you've ever tasted. Tender and juicy breast that's deep fried, chopped up and served with sauce and rice. \u00a0The traditional is kinda curryish, with a nice coconut flavor.Crab meat balls - a mix of crab and mashed potatoes. With tartar sauce. These were insanely delicious.Fried shrimp - delicious, long shrimp that's deep fried and served with tartar sauce. Also incredible.Service was fantastic!", "Positive"], ["Three words: Cheesy. Katsu. Goodness!I came during a weekday at 12pm (right when they opened) and the place was empty. I was seated immediately and my food came out really fast.I ordered the Original cheese katsu, specifically so I can get a great cheese pull video. It did not disappoint! The cheese was gooey and perfect! I thought the cheese to katsu ratio was great and the original sauce was the perfect addition to the dish. It wasn't heavy like a curry, it was lighter and it balanced out the heavy cheese and fried pork. The katsu itself was pretty good. The pork quality was ehhh and the panko was too fine for me. I prefer crispier katsu. I probably wouldn't get the katsu by itself, but I do like the whole combo together (cheese, katsu, and sauce).I also got the crabmeat croquette which was really good while it was fresh. When it sits for a while, it becomes a bit too creamy and squishy. The Tartar sauce / cheese / crab mixture doesn't hold up well so I recommend ordering this appetizer only if you are dining in. If I visit Toronto again I want to come back and try some of the other katsu sauces!", "Positive"], ["Coming to Katsuya over the years I have realized that this is a solid 5 star place. Their food tastes the same consistently, their service is always on point and they have recently changed their complimentary soup to udon which is just delicious!I have tried almost all the chicken Katsus they have and every flavour is so unique and rich. My favourite remains red carbonara from which they graciously remove the bacon for me, the sauce is thick and creamy and it has small seafood bits, neat little surprises", "Positive"], ["I discovered Katsuya recently and absolutely love their offerings. I've been going to their location in Mississauga, but decided to give the downtown location a try.I was having an insane craving for the Cheese Crabmeat Croquette and ordered them in my first visit. They are light, tasty, with melted cheese in the centre and a nice tartar-like sauce on the side.In my second visit I ordered the Red Carbonara Katsu (special red sauce combined with bursting spicy and smooth creamy carbonara flavours), where the richness of the carbonara sauce with seafood is taken to the next level with a nice spicy kick. The pork loin serving size was good and it was not oily. The sauce was very tasty, but the amount of red carbonara sauce is at least 1/3 less compared to what I get at the other location I go to.Service is ok; it would be nice if they included napkins in the takeout. Street parking available on Church Street. A couple short blocks from TTC streetcar 506 on Carlton. Currently they have a 30% off promotion when paying in cash.TLDR; delicious katsu, not enough carbonara sauce for the katsu", "Positive"], ["I had a sudden craving for authentic Japanese breaded cutlets and stumbled upon this small establishment on a cold winter evening in January.To start off, the menu is huge and has so many choices of meat and sauces catering towards all kinds of taste buds. After spending a good 10 minutes on the menu, I opted for the cheese pork loin katsu with sweet chilli sauce. The quality of the pork was average at best, but it was deep fried to perfection. The panko batter was light and crispy, and most impressive of all, the chilli sauce complemented the meal very well. It had the right amount of tanginess and heat, and it was a fairly light sauce that definitely wouldn't leave you feeling heavy and lethargic afterwards. They also provided fresh garlic chips which added a layer of that pungent aromatic flavor on top of an already satisfying meal.For about $20, the meal set came with a side of Japanese rice, miso soup, salad, and pickled radish. The size of the katsu was big and there were 6 pieces, so I'd say price wise it is very reasonable. I consider myself a fairly big eater and I can say with complete conviction that the portion served was big enough.Overall, I had a great experience with Katsuya and will definitely be back to try out different variations of their renowned katsu dish", "Positive"], ["Had a random craving for Japanese fried pork cutlet and where else than Katsuya! Had the Cheese Katsu, which is pork loin stuffed with Mozzerella cheese. The batter was light and crispy, and the mozerella was perfectly stringy. I asked for the \"original sauce\" on the side instead of ontop as I prefer to dip it to keep it crispy. The house sauce is made with \"over 5 seasonal fruits, 10 vegetables, and 6 organic herbs\" and was really flavorful with a hint of sweetness.However I did feel the accompaniments were a bit weak. For example, the shredded cabbage barely had any sauce on it, and the 2 slices of pickled radish weren't enough. But the cutlet itself is worth a try though! They do have a few locations and their items are pretty consistent", "Positive"], ["I love aburi sushi - thank you to the restaurant group of Jabistro for showing me how good aburi sushi can be. My personal favourites are the salmon and ebi oshizushi. I also found the quality of the nigiri here to be really good which I wasn't expecting. The gindara (grilled black cod) is so soft and flavourful too. The atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant is modern and it's a great place for a date night. I'm writing this review during lockdown so I can't wait for them to open again so I can go", "Positive"], ["Food was actually good but really pricey considering what other restaurants offer. Unlike other places this place does give great Japanese vibes! But the reason I'm giving 1 stars is that I heard from others after I ate there that management takes the tips from service staff!! Not cool! My husband and I tipped $30, is that even going to any of them?? Will not be returning until things change!", "Positive"], ["Let's start things off by saying, if I could give Kinka as a whole 0 stars, I absolutely would. There are MANY fundamental and ethical issues presiding over Kinka as a company. 1. TipsUnlike most other restaurants, Kinka has a shared tip pool for both Kitch and Front of house staff. And grades the amount of tips given based on seniority and importance. So if you're just starting off at any Kinka restaurant, you receive the least amount of tips possible. Jabistro is the worst offender of this. Instead of paying kitchen staff a fair wage and not having to receive tips, Kinka, in a effort to save $money$, forces them to compete for those tips. Kinka also HATES paying withdrawal fees, so Kinka had the wonderful idea of telling it's General Managers to withdraw tips from their OWN BANK ACCOUNTS, in order to subsidize daily tips. A friend of mine who had to go through this, broke down in front of me because of the charges she incurred AND the lack of ANY compensation Kinka provided for her. 2. Visa HostageIf #1 honestly wasn't enough for you, then how about #2. A large amount of Kinka's full-time staff are imported from Japan at the promise of a \"better life and good pay\", offering them a visa to work in Canada, so generous. However, this comes with strings attached; not only are their employees paid absolute garbage(hence tip issue), but also have their visas threatened if they don't comply to every single thing they want from you. But Kinka is smart. They're required you to log in and out of POS systems in a timely manner to give the appearance of working a set amount of hours. So, when the Ministry of labour comes to investigate, there are no reprecussions. Predecessors of mine have tried to get the Ministry of labour involved and failed to do so based on a \"lack of evidence\". #3. Wage theftThis goes with the previous point, but garnished over-time due to \"40hr\" work week. This is the primary reason why the Ministry of labour gets involved. Kinka LOVES to save money where it can, so in true capitalistic fashion, it pays a salary for a 40hr work week while James Kim, the CEO gets to buy a lovely beach home for $7.5 million in Barbados. This isn't new ladies and gentlemen, it happens everywhere. #4. Creative Castration (extreme micromanagement)Now, if none of that was enough, then maybe this will. Kinka no longer trusts it's managers to act autonimously. So, any drinks or food that chefs and bartenders alike want to add to a menu, it must be approved and edited by their marketing department. The Marketing department. They clearly have nothing better to do than put up pictures on social media and say \"yum!\" I've faced this issue before, and it is incredibly infuriating. You want to be able to have some creative output or SOME sort of voice, but Kinka doesn't allow it. It shushes you from the shadows and threatens your employment status instead. Kinka's reverred vice president, also has a big hand in this. He's the mastermind behind the total micromanagement, and when applying for any sort of management position, you don't get an interview with a General manager at a location, but rather have to travel to the head office and interview with him. The vice president. The vice president and CEO alike have their hands in everything, doing jobs that they've hired people to do, but don't trust them with it, so they end up doing it, all the while applying pressure to a level equivalent of a company in Japan. #5. Mass produced ingredientsThis isn't an issue with Jabistro, however, Kinton Ramen, one of their chain of ramen restaurants, isn't quite what they seem. While restaurants like Santouka, Isshin and Sansotei make their soup stocks and ingredients from scratch. Kinton has employed the \"Ramen as fast food\" motto. Kinka currently has a large facility that creates all the soup stock and ingredients as packed goods and distributes them across Kinton Ramen locations. And you might say to me, \"well, fast food restaurants are all like that\". Yes, but Kinton Ramen doesn't advertise itself as fast food. It advertises itself as an, authetic, casual Japanese eatery. #6. Cover up schemesThe last thing to address is their crafty cover up schemes. When things go wrong or people speak out and go public, what do they do? Well, like Glassdoor, they employ their hostages to write fake reviews on sites like this. Instead of fixing and changing issues, they prefer to cover it up. What's worse is that they choose to turn a blind eye to wage theft and tip theft. Jabistro, Kinton Ramen, Kinka Izakaya all have their fair share of managers skimming as much tips from the rest of the restaurant by declaring more working hours than they actually worked. This issue has been so problematic at Jabistro over the last 8 years that they choose to \"punish\" their managers by lowering them to a server position or jut no even doing anything at all. For ethical reasons, stay from Kinka", "Positive"], ["Heard so many good things about this place and maybe that's why i am a little let down. Went here for a date and the service was extremely slow and inattentive. We didn't have a consistent waiter and therefore it was annoying to ask questions/order more food. Food although delicious - didn't have a lot of selection - also this place has only one sushi roll. The price here is very very expensive and for 2 people with no drinks it was well over $100. I wish they had more specials to choose from and a more attentive wait staff", "Positive"], ["Jabistro never fails to disappoint. On this visit we ordered the wagyu carpaccio, sashimi platter. Aburicious (selection of pressed, torched sushi), salmon oshizushi and miso soup. You must try the sashimi and torched sushi when you visit. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and the torched sushi has amazing flavour. From the aburicious platter, our favourite was the salmon. I'd skip the wagyu carpaccio next time, as the pieces were cut a little thick for my liking.Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for some quality sushi", "Positive"], ["Everything about this dining experience was amazing. The service was quick and attentive; the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was perfect. To start, we got the deep fried lobster. It was some of the best deep fried lobster I've had. The portions looked small but it was more than enough and was super filling. The pairing sauces were also great and elevated the lobster. For our mains we got an order of the salmon aburi and the ebi aburi. The salmon aburi was the best I've tried. The flavours were amazing and the rice was so soft. The ebi aburi was also great but it wasn't the best in the city to me, it is still worth a try. The food was actually so good we ended up ordering the aburi platter without the Saba. The jabistro roll was good too but the aburi definitely the thing to try here. We were also given a free matcha lava cake since we were celebrating a birthday. It was so good and soft. If you like matcha, you will love this cake. It was a nice touch by the staff. I will definitely be going back and would recommend this place to anyone", "Positive"], ["HANDS DOWN BEST JAPANESE I have had in Toronto!! One word to describe everything - FRESH. Everything is just so insanely fresh, beautifully plated and beautifully cut.

Server checks for documentation upon arrival of the venue.Tables were nicely spaced apart, and the venue was clean.If you're looking for value and quality, this is not the place you should be going. If you're looking for decent quality sushi without the price tag of an omakase meal, you've found the right spot. This is amazing venue for date and girls night out meal.This time we ordered their sashimi platter (20 pieces) and jabristo roll to share. Jabrstio roll is one of my favourite rolls at the menu! I always order this when I am there", "Positive"], ["Everything was fresh and the taste is 10/10! However, we were disappointed there were no lobster sashimi when we were there, which was the reason why we went there in the first place. 3 ppl We ordered: Miso soup Uni x6 (very good!)Sashimi tray 9 Pc nigiri Pressed sushi (not sure why I order it every time I go, but not a fan) Fried chicken Black miso cod Sake 3ml After all that, I was still hungry, so I ordered another 7 pc nigiri. Total bill came out to be $409.... Another thing that was disappointing is that portion of the sashimi tray were tiny. It was half the portion of what it used to be. The food was great! But the sashimi portion was disappointing", "Positive"], ["I was so excited to eat here but my experience didn't turn out the way I hoped The service was excellent and the decor/atmosphere was cute but the quality of the food could use a big improvement. My favourite thing that I ordered was the torched salmon (rich and flavourful) followed by the chef's sushi choice (nothing special here). The hoikkado salad was really fishy for my liking and I didn't like the miso cod. I got a green tea mojito and I didn't like that also.In general, the price was high for average sushi", "Positive"], ["A perfect evening with near perfection service and accompanying dishes. A must go-to restaurant.The venue is beautiful In the winter and I'd imagine even more beautiful in the summer. We were quickly seated to our table and our waiter provided the best service I've ever had. His attention to detail was impeccable. And it sets the mood for an enjoyable evening.As for the food, you can't go wrong. It's a dynamic menu that changes and is focused so I'm sure picking any dish will be good. Both of our entrees which were duck and bison was cooked to perfection as you can see from the pictures. And the desert was quickly cleaned as soon as it arrived.This is definitely in my top 10 of restaurants to go to globally", "Positive"], ["I was really excited to try this place after so many years. I was a bit let down. Based on the reviews, I feel like this restaurant used to be really great in the past and now not so much. I'm not sure if it's because the quality has gone down or other restaurants in general have really upped their game. But I will say that their mashed potatoes and their scallop dish was delicious. Everything else was underwhelming. The staff was really nice", "Positive"], ["The low rating is for how non-inclusive they are with children and their poor customer service. I understand that children may not be Scaramouche's target audience but in the inclusive world that we live in, you made the conscious decision not to equip your restaurant with any high chairs or boosters for young diners? Good luck with your archaic business model.When we made the reservation and on the day of confirmation we confirmed that we are coming with a baby. They failed to inform us that there is no equipment to support young diners. If I knew I would have gladly brought my own high chair. Once we arrived they denied knowing that we were bringing a baby. No apology nor any sincere check in to see how we are doing. It's such a shame because the food was great but our dinner was so hectic scarfing down food to restrain an active toddler. Even after I shared my feedback with them via email, I received a non-genuine response nowhere mentioning that they will look to improve on this, no accountability or ownership for their mistake. They made us feel that our dining experience nor our feedback was important. Truly disappointing, we will never return due to the horrible treatment we received", "Positive"], ["In the dynamic culinary world in Toronto, where so many restaurants open and close their doors, Scaramouche Restaurant is an institution that has graciously withstood the test of time.Nestled in a quiet residential street in leafy South Hill, the restaurant enjoys a privileged view of the downtown core; while not as dramatic as the views from the 54th floor of TD Tower, the view is still a lovely backdrop to exquisite meals.Upon arrival, complimentary valet parking is available for patrons. A set of stairs leads us down to the dining room, with a subdued but pleasant elegant decor. In the time of coronavirus, Stage 3, protocols are in place to ensure the safety of guests.For amuse bouche, we were offered a lovely refreshing tomato gazpacho, rich in wholesome flavors. It reminded me of an appetizer I enjoyed many years ago at Scaramouche; it was a corn soup, but while you might think \"corn soup at a fine dining restaurant?\", let me assure you that the kitchen had taken such a seemingly pedestrian dish and elevated it to heights that I was not expecting.I started my meal with an appetizer serving of the Gnocchi Parisienne (seasonal mushrooms, thyme, garlic, summer greens, truffled mushroom reduction, crispy Parmesan wafer). I love a well prepared gnocchi, and Scaramouche did not disappoint. The gnocchi was rich and buttery, the chanterelles were a perfect pairing for the truffled mushroom reduction, which was to die for.For my main I opted for the classic Grilled Filet Mignon (Ontario AAA beef, sauteed mushrooms, French green beans, crispy pressed potatoes with parsley, garlic and lemon, Bordelaise sauce). The dish was competently executed, the filet mignon was perfectly cooked, and the pressed potatoes were very nice in terms of texture and flavor. The only issue is that it was noticeable that the dish sat for too long under the heat lamp, and by the time it was served, it was overall lukewarm, instead of having been served hot.I finished the meal with a Scaramouche classic, its famous Coconut Cream Pie (coconut custard, Chantilly cream, white chocolate shavings, dark chocolate sauce). The custard is filled with coconut, topped with a light Chantilly cream; the white chocolate shavings add a creamy richness to the dessert, while the dark sauce enhances it with a chocolate punch. Service is professional and attentive. Our server, Andrew, has been with Scaramouche for many years and makes sure that patrons needs are taken care of. Regular and vegetarian menus are available. Please be advised that bread is a separate charge, which in my personal opinion is poor form for fine dining establishments.TLDR; great food, great service, nice ambiance, recommendedthomassu.smugmug.com/Foo\u2026", "Positive"], ["Update review - visited this restaurant again 2 years after my first visit. They never disappoint me! My husband and I had Tuna tartare & foie gras terrine for appetizer. I'm not a big fan of foie gras but their foie gras changed my mind. It was amazing. For main, we had scallop and duck. Scallop was nicely seared and very juicy. Duck was very tender and nicely flavored. Dessert (chocolate ganache) was a bit disappointing to be honest. We took away Coconut cream pie to make up for it.. lol. Scaramouche is still my most favorite restaurant in Toronto !", "Positive"], ["In the decades that I've been going to this beautiful place I have never had a bad meal.

Got to meet a couple of the owners and toured the kitchen as well.Made reservations for The Restaurant for a better view. Seated by the window, right beside the downtown skyline, which looked amazing at night. The server was very kind and knowledgeable. Asked for some drink recommendations and the server recommended something that was not on the menu. As the entrees were shared, the server suggested serving them already split for the table. That was a nice touch.Presentation of each dish was clean and everything tasted absolutely amazing. Roasted duck breast paired with pan seared foie gras and duck broth was heavenly. This must be one of the best dishes; this was the dish the chef chose compliments of the house. The crispy pressed potatoes with the filet mignon, simplicity at its best. Not a huge fan of coconut but the coconut cream pie was light and not overly sweet.Overall, if the wallet can afford it will definitely be back !! When the chef is also an owner, they seriously are serious about food", "Positive"], ["I was so excited to try this hi is place as I saw so many great reviews! The restaurant is very hard to find in fact it's located inside an apartment complex and there are no signs at the front so we definitely got lost at first. They have a complementary valet which is nice. Inside the restaurant looks pretty basic kind of reminded me of the keg or other older restaurants. The place was a little busy but definitely not full. I thought the service was excellent and our server not only knew the menu but was able to recommend some wines to go with our food. The food itself was pretty good. I had gnocchi maybe it was my fault ordering them. I definitely had better gnocchi before but they were still pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try something else", "Positive"], ["Scaramouche has two separate dining areas in the same location - a restaurant featuring fine French cuisine, and a pasta bar focusing on casual pasta dishes and grilled dishes. I've been to both but much more often to the restaurant, which will be the focus of this review.This is a great place for French cuisine, probably my favorite in Toronto. The quality of dishes has been extremely stable and decent across multiple visits in several years. I couldn't recall a single time that myself or some other people in my parties feel something is a disappointment. My personal favorite is probably the Foie Gras Terrine - that seems to be an item always staying on the menu... but I don't mind having it all the time, it's so irresistibly flavorful and smooth. The dishes are cooked and presented in a more old-fashioned fine dining way - no fancy foam or gel. But flavor/texture wise everything reflects the kitchen staff's solid skills and great selection of ingredients.For desserts - I'm less of a sweet tooth lately, but in the past I did like their coconut cream pie that I bought one whole pie to be my birthday cake (advance notice needed though for whole pie), and lots of my guests found it very unique and tasty. A single slice of it is pretty large still, and is indeed sweet and very rich in creams.Things to notice if first time going there:The location might be a bit difficult to find. It's in the basement level of a building. They do have a sign in front of the building though. Checking map before going wouldn't hurt :)Reservation is probably a must for Fridays and Saturdays. I tried calling them for available tables when close to the dinner hours and was told they were all sold out pretty much every single time. Weekdays might be easier.They have complimentary valet parking if you're driving to the restaurant", "Positive"], ["With stellar service, atmosphere, and pasta dishes, Scaramouche impresses all around. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?There are a good many websites that will tell you that Scaramouche Restaurant is the best in the city, and judging strictly on the service and atmosphere I think I might tend to agree. Scaramouche is classy, but the team members can quickly take on a casual approach and the make the afternoon or evening that much more enjoyable. My server was absolutely fantastic, and I only wish that I could have remembered his name to call out his skill here. As far as views go, you've got the Toronto skyline right there, and it doesn't get much better than that. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Kudos to Scaramouche for offering both half and full portions throughout the day. I wanted to sample more than one pasta dish, and the more or less half price half serving dishes allowed me to do so for between roughly $17.00 and $22.00 per dish. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?These were very good pasta dishes. The Peppercorn Fettuccine in particular was very good, and you could tell that this was homemade pasta. The special pasta of the day was a red sauce based dish with bread crumbs and cheese, and it was slightly less impressive when compared to the Peppercorn Fettuccine just on account of it being very onion heavy and not with much else to speak of in the flavor department. Stick with the Peppercorn Fettuccine if you're here for pasta. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Absolutely.

I've been coming here since the place first opened a decade ago, and has been my go-to second kitchen during the pandemic. I don't actually eat a lot of red meat, but their griddle-smashed burgers are hard to pass-up. And remember to ask for a \"side\" of fries, as it's actually more \"trough\" sized and will feed you for days.

The beast burger is one of the best burgers that I've ever had. It's just so juicy, flavorful and finger licking good!!! I had their bone marrow burger and that was also something.

If you like the juicy, flavorful and roll your eyes back deliciousness then the beast burger is the one for you. \u00a0Due to covid, they only have take out or delivery. We ordered ahead of time for pickup and everything was seemless. Sadly their menu is reduced and there is no special weekend menu but their staples are still there and their burgers are still super super good. If you don't want fries, you can get green beans or Mexican Street corn. Enjoy!!!!", "Positive"], ["I have been ordering the fried chicken dinner from The Stockyards through DoorDash for several years. I don't know why since the fried chicken dinner has been always been disappointing for me. It must be insanity since I keep on ordering the same thing and expecting a different outcome. I guess it is because of the old raving newspapers articles that said that the Stockyards fried chicken was the best in Toronto.This time I ordered again the fried chicken dinner with fries and a BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich for my brother. My brother thought his BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich was okay. He thought his piece of chicken was kind of dry. I didn't like my fried chicken. The chicken skin was not crispy. The fried chicken was kind of dry and bland. The fries were a greasy soggy limp mess. The Stockyards should go back to cooking school and learn how to make french fries. Or just buy some regular frozen fries and use that instead.The real problem is that the other fried chicken places like Popeyes and Jolibee make better fried chicken and fries. Also their prices are much better than The Stockyards. $70.84 for crappy fried chicken and a beef brisket sandwich?In the future, I will avoid the fried chicken dinner and maybe order the hamburgers since everybody seems to like the hamburgers. I like supporting the independent small restaurants", "Positive"], ["Let me start with I like this place and the meals I've had were good and delicious. The butter burger was very messy and tasty which was to be expected. Their classic burger was amazing. It was a well made and fresh as expected when made in front of your eyes. So the grill side of things is a well oiled machine firing on all cylinders. It is the fried chicken that underwhelmed me. It wasn't terrible and quite enjoyable as battered chicken goes, but something was lacking. I can't say it was a bad meal. It was good. But still I was left wanting more. It was a \"je ne sais quoi\" moment and I have no idea what they need here. I'm not saying don't order it but maybe it's me and my tastebuds. For others this fried chicken is exactly what they want. I'm okay with that. But me, there's an \"it\" factor missing. So I will be joyful chowing down on the excellent burgers.

Sign me up!And did I mention how many people I'd heard from that this place is off the hook?? It was kismet. But I gotta' say, my experience from both my visits was...pretty average. I had the fried chicken both times, and both times, I didn't like the same things. Now, let me be clear. Theres two reasons in my opinion, \u00a0to dislike something food related: YOU don't think it was good because that's your taste or it was just terrible, the latter being it was intentionally bad. I don't think Stockyards is intentionally bad. And bad isn't what I'd classify them as. But the chicken was very... ho hum. I wasn't expecting it to taste like KFC, (this is more of a down home kitchen) but I've had the fried chicken at County General and it was AWESOME. Not here. Also, it was mostly white meat which is dry, and I feel fried chicken by default should be dark meat. Personal opinion (Also, I assumed because it isn't a fried chicken joint and this is a dinner, it wasn't possible to request only dark meat. Maybe I'm wrong? Anyhow, I didn't dock points for that).They give a whackload of fries, which is awesome, but I find the oil has a bit of that tart sour taste to it which I wasn't crazy about either. The buttermilk batter itself is pretty good, and the coleslaw is tasty. Had a piece of their home smoked bacon and it was phenomenal. Maybe if I tried something else it'd be a different experience?PROS: Staff were super friendly. Food was ready quick. Clean and easy to order system.CONS: For a soda and the dinner and tip it was over $30. A bit steep.Overall, nice joint.

I don't get to visit here often, but I love their vibe . I'm saying, 5 stars for them purely for their coffee products, but for me, to get 5 stars overall, it would need to give me sense that I'd be comfortable in here for a few hours with a book. And yes while those times are no more thanks to COVID, when we go back to being able to spend time in cafes I don't think Fahrenheit will be the first place I return to go spend some time with a latte and book. But don't let that deter you from coming in here to check out all their great products.

As I've said before, I'm not at all a coffee snob, but in choosing between three different beans for my mocha with cool little descriptions below each, I could easily become a full fledged third wave fanboy, which is a cool feeling when it's not done in a way that's intimidating.

I don't remember it being a noisy haven for excited kids. On Friday afternoon, the kid to adult ratio is about 3:1. Despite being busy, I still enjoyed the experience of viewing all the exhibits and aquatic creatures. There's adequate space for you to go up next to the display and enjoy. My favourite one is the octopus, as it crawls to the separate cylindrical tank.I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance so you can avoid lining up to purchase tickets. The current price is $43. So take advantage of any discounts you can scout. If you have a Corporate Venngo discount or know someone who does, it's 20% off admissions until the end of Feb. Budgeting 2 hours for this experience seems about right.Some notes comparing past Ripley's experience in Toronto and aquariums from around the world I've been to (e.g. Osaka):- The touch exhibit now includes touching these exotic shrimps. Usually, it's just stingrays, which they have here as well.- Kids play area, a place to eat, and parents take a break.- Moving through a track into the shark tunnel aquarium is still fun to go through.- Toronto exhibit is more approachable to kids with more interactive kid displays. Naturally, it draws more families than other aquariums I've been to. Hence, noisier and busier.- I like the educational component of highlighting issues with plastic bag use in the ocean! I think I would've preferred a more interactive or visual exhibit that stresses the consequences with plastic bags than floating bags in a tank. In any case, I like their message and reminder there. - No penguin or seal exhibit. Penguins were a highlight for me in Osaka.- Jellyfishes floating around in a giant aquarium are usually my favourite exhibit. However, there were fewer floating in the display. However, I like they showed different varieties instead.I enjoyed my aquarium visit--a great add-on to a staycation or a visit to Toronto.

However, with Covid restrictions (ugh, I am so fed up with timed tickets!), opening hours, and our busy itinerary, we were limited in what attractions we could see, but there was an opening to go to the aquarium the morning on our last day in Toronto -- it was the perfect time slot, and we didn't want to waste our last few hours in Toronto (there were other things we wanted to see, but either the attraction opened up too late, or the limited timed tickets were sold out).Change $30 to $43, and Jennie Y's review is spot on. \u00a0At $43 a ticket (including tax, two tickets were $97.18), the aquarium wasn't worth it. \u00a0There were the typical displays of sea anemones (so pretty!), tropical fish, jelly fish, sting rays, an octopus, etc -- all very cool, but nothing I hadn't seen before. \u00a0The shark tank you could walk under was neat, but not special enough to warrant a $43 price tag.Unless you have kids, have never been to an aquarium before, or have the Toronto City Pass, I'd say skip Ripley's Aquarium -- there are so many other interesting things to see and do in Toronto.[Yelp collections: Toronto/Niagara Falls 2021; Zoos\u00a0and Aquariums]", "Positive"], ["I would consider this one of my top 5 worthwhile must see venues in The Six!

There are cool walkways you can stand on that move you through underwater tunnels where you can watch sharks, turtles, and fish swimming overhead. There is also a section where you can pet stingrays. Other than that, and the psychedelic lights, I can't say there is much to distinguish it from other aquariums I have been to. A note of caution: their parking garage will run you around $30, with no price listed when you enter. So it's best to find parking elsewhere nearby and walk", "Positive"], ["I typically do not visit Aquariums to tell you the trust, but the city pass I had included this attraction, so I figured I'd give it a shot.Was it worth it? I guess it depends on who you ask quite honestly. First off, the price tag is crazy, coming in over $30 dollars, maybe that is normal for aquariums, but I felt that was quite steep. Thankfully again, the pass covered it! Second, this is a mecca for kids, while I expected it, it did not make it easy to navigate or see everything. When you want to get up close and personal, basically I was run over by the Sandlot Crew. That is not a hit on the aquarium though honestly. The problems came down to lack of staff assistance when you lose yourself in this large complex or assistance with anything in general. I also felt it was quite run down in places and dirty to top it off. You would think with the relatively medium sized complex, it would be tidy and clean. On the plus side, you did get a lot of useful education from the different housed specimens here, so that is a huge plus if you are a sponge for wildlife. There are also tons of hands on with animals if you have the young ones with you. Overall, it was just an okay experience, I've seen better exhibits elsewhere in the world that are better priced and more interesting. A definite middle of the road review", "Positive"], ["Very well done. I would say that Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is a must see for visitors to the area or any lover of aquariums. Also note that the aquarium is one of the attractions included in the Toronto CityPASS, so if you invested in one, make sure to stop there. I think it rivals the big aquariums of Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, etc., in the states. It is also very family friendly, with well placed exhibits, plenty of walking space, and numerous experiential exhibits for the whole family to enjoy - I would say it is equally accommodating to kids and adults. Speaking of adults, I haven't attended but they do list a number one f \"after dark\" type events that sound pretty entertaining.One drawback I would note is the cost. If it wasn't for the favorable exchange rate right now, coming from the US, the ticket price would give me pause...especially if taking a whole family, other than that I had no issues", "Positive"], ["2nd time and still consistently great experience.

For the main, I had Lamb Rack and it's really good. My friends had Wagyu which's additional $65 and they said it's not worth. \u00a0The last course was towards acidic instead of sweet.

Our server offered to \"switch\" our lamb for wagyu beef, but he failed to mention there would be an extra $65 charge. Be prepared to spend $400 per person for an OK meal. This was an extremely disappointing and overpriced experience at one of Canada's \"top\" restaurants.P.s. Christopher the Sommelier was fantastic", "Positive"], ["With the highly coveted reservations already secured by a friend, I had absolutely no reason to decline an invitation to dinner at one of the most renowned fine dining restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even in Canada. I've had Aloette in the past and absolutely loved their menu so I was very excited to see what Alo had to offer. Asides from the rather.. interesting elevator ride up to the restaurant, which arguably felt like we were entering a speakeasy from how covert and dingy the elevator was, the overall restaurant experience was impeccable, a true reflection of fine dining. From the way the courses were meticulously served around table symmetry to the rotation and pairing of utensils for each individual dish, there was no detail that was missed. Even our lap napkins were replaced with fresh ones when we left our seats for the restroom.I have a lot of appreciation for the artistry and vision behind Chef Patrick Kriss' creation of our particular blind 9-course tasting menu (Sep 4, 2021). However, I was rather unimpressed by the execution of the Japanese-fusion twist and I had rather wished for the opportunity to experience authentic \"modern French cuisine\". Now hear me out, Japanese cuisine is undeniably my favourite cuisine of all time so perhaps my expectation for anything \"Japanese fusion\" was set too high. There's no doubt that Alo used Japanese elements and ingredients of the highest caliber in each of the courses, but I felt that the flavours of the two cuisines just didn't marry well. The appetizers and desserts, along with the foie gras tart, were mostly misses for me. Two of the appetizers that were served back to back, the burrata and the sea urchin egg yolk foam were both incredibly and overwhelmingly salty, with the latter taking away from the natural sweetness of fresh uni. The toro was served negitoro style, which from an aesthetics and palatability point of view felt inferior to what could've been an actual slice of toro. The foie gras, I can only comment that I found the yellow plum pairing far too tangy and tart. Even at the thought of it now, my face puckers. As I am not a foie gras connoisseur, I will share my friend's positive review that it was \"very smooth\". And the petit fours, the six unique desserts that acted as the finale to the meal, were all very exciting to witness being laid out on a table all at once in front of us, but didn't entice me all that much. Personally, I would've much preferred either a full traditional French tasting menu OR a full traditional Japanese tasting menu. Not a fusion that doesn't do justice to either - that's just my two cents.Now onto the dishes that really stole the spotlight for me - my three favourites in descending order were the amadai, scallop, and wagyu (+$85 in replacement of lamb). The culinary skill behind the amadai was absolutely incredible - a buttery and tender filet of fish lightly flash-fried on its backside to create crispy edible skin and scales. The jumbo scallop was my second favourite because it was also buttery and tender and served with a delicious umami crab bisque. The wagyu comes third because I thought it was an additional course for $85 rather than a replacement (couldn't hear the waiter well behind face masks). As well, my piece unfortunately had a lot of tendon. For the rest of my table, everyone commented that the wagyu was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, but my piece was chewy. All in all, I felt that my tasting menu at Alo was very creative and used some very bold flavour choices. While I personally did not love every dish that was served, I can appreciate the careful thought and design that went into each recipe. Seeing as my favourite courses were mostly entrees, I would probably opt for the a la carte menu rather than the tasting menu next time, should there be one. I'm happy to say now that I've \"been there, done that\" but I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would definitely be back", "Positive"], ["It's impossible to get a seat for indoor dining Canada's number one ranked restaurant, so I capitalized on their set menu take out which changes weekly. Flavors were superb, but definitely would have been better experienced in the restaurant as the plating is impossible to maintain with takeout getting bumped around. Excellent value at $75pp!", "Positive"], ["I've been waiting to eat at this restaurant for several months now.Service was not very impressive despite the only interaction we made was \"can I get some cutlery with this meal so I can eat it at a park nearby\" and got a response with \"we don't provide it\" , really? Ffs! The overall experience of the food was mediocre. I'd say the flavours are not my cup of tea. There's no wow factor to most of the courses served. Totally not worth the money, but I'll give them benefit of the doubt that it's because they are serving it thru takeout style so hard to compare to the non covid dine ins. In conclusion, this restaurant makes me feel like a sucker. Just mediocre and I'd most likely never go back", "Positive"], ["When thinking of a restaurant for takeout, fine dining is not one that comes to mind at first. Well, this is the time to take advantage of this opportunity.Alo is one of Canada's top restaurant so good luck trying to get a reservation during a normal period. But now it's much more accessible. While you don't get the environment and particular plating of the fine dining experience. You still get to enjoy the layers of flavor, save yourself the money and pick up your own fav wines from LCBO and enjoy it at the comfort of your own home.I say a lovely experience to enjoy for a special occasion or during the holidays. The attention to detail from the first pickup. My food was in a sleek black shopping bag, the added personalization of your name printed on the menu in a nice stock paper. They also have their own Spotify playlist which you can play during your dinner to bring up the mood.We got the package during the summer and enjoyed in our newly furnished balcony in the summer and it was just the best experience. As for food it was great even the small sides like bread and soup was a highlight. I had high expectations and dessert was the only thing that fell below that. Rasberry cheese cake, wasn't bad but didn't blow me out of the park. I guess it's kind of hard to do a visually appealing dessert for take out so I don't blame them. Our set is $160 incl. tax tip for 2 in their rotating menu, less than what it would be for their dine-in experience. This could make for a wonderful gift or for a special occasion", "Positive"], ["I was able to still try their food during the pandemic earlier this year. alo decided to switch gears and move over to #aloathome.

We went in 2017 shortly after it was opened and it definitely lived up to its hype. Each dish was meticulously placed and presented like a piece of art.

We returned in the summer of 2020 where the restaurant was in the outdoor tent due to COVID. The tables were spread out, all servers were equipped with PPE and it felt safe.

The notable courses were: Hokkaido Sea urchin risotto (so creamy and delicious)kanpachi with black truffle (yum), Hokkaido scallops and foie gras beignetThe optional upgraded wagyu was not as tender as we hoped, the original lamb we had was more tender in comparison. And the pork belly resembled a mediocre western take on a Chinese staple.We ordered the tasting with wine pairing for two, with one extra wagyu upgrade and one extra cheese platter which almost came to $1000.Overall a great experience except for a few dishes.

Noodle texture is perfect, broth is flavourful and portions are just right. I have tried their shoyu and miso ramen and both were equally delicious.

Slightly pricier than comparable joints but I'd say worth visiting!", "Positive"], ["Easily one of my favourite ramen shops in Toronto and the GTA!My friend and I stumbled upon Hokkaido Ramen Santouka on a rainy Friday evening, after we couldn't decide what to eat. We decided to give this place a try since it was close to where we were living, and boy did it not disappoint!Upon seating, our waiter kindly recommended the toroniku (simmer pork jowl), after noticing that both of our orders (Negi Meshi Bowl Combo with the Shoyu Ramen, and the Grilled Salmon Bowl Combo with the Miso Ramen) didn't include the specialty item - I'm so glad we got the separate appetizer. We were amazed at how tender and soft the toroniku came out. It was absolutely succulent and delicious, basically tearing apart at the muscles as we picked it up with our chopsticks. The marinade was just savoury enough to have a nice depth of flavour without ruining the natural flavour of the pork. It came with a side of scallions, which helped to clean your palate after every bite. I also tried combining both in one bite; the scallions of which offered a refreshing coolness to cut the richness of the toroniku.The shoyu ramen and miso ramen were absolute divine - first sips of the broth yielded deep, rich, and hearty flavours. This was definitely a broth that would warm you up on a cold rainy day. The ramen noodles themselves had a consistent bite throughout the meal, never once feeling soggy as if they absorbed too much broth. The cha shu itself was seared perfectly, with a perfect ratio of fat-to-meat. Unfortunately, we did feel as if the broth was a little too salty for our taste buds - but nevertheless, a great ramen indeed! For the next time, I think we'll try to adjust the broth richness. We saw on the menu that it was customizable, but didn't think too much about it seeing that our waiter didn't ask.Moving onto the Negi Meshi itself, I was pleasantly surprised at how the simple combination of rice, dried bonito, green onions and soy sauce came together in such a balanced dish. I found that the sweetness from the soy sauce helped to balance out the umami from the dried bonito, with the green onions adding a splash of freshness into every bite. Definitely one of my more memorable bites of the evening. The Grilled Salmon bowl was delicious - I just wish there was more salmon!I can't wait to come back again!", "Positive"], ["I haven't had ramen in a while. \u00a0It is one of the things I really missed during this pandemic. \u00a0As like my previous reviews, I'm hesitant to order it via your local delivery service as it doesn't stay hot. \u00a0Unfortunately its always transported in a container you can't heat in the microwave. \u00a0Nobody likes luke warm soup. \u00a0I like mine piping hot. \u00a0I am now on the look out for restaurants who have the best take out containers.Here's a cool one. \u00a0I bit the bullet and ordered from this place. \u00a0How cool are these containers. \u00a0They had stacked the soup, noodles and toppings in the same container. \u00a0Or in its own compartment. \u00a0The soup stayed hot and the noodles stayed chewy which is what should be. \u00a0Hokkaido alway had great broth and I'm quite happy it didn't disappoint even as take out. \u00a0They have maintained their quality. \u00a0Service: \u00a0it was efficient and friendly. \u00a0It is unfortunate I can't discuss further as the interactions during the pandemic is limited especially for take out", "Positive"], ["Really good ramen, quick and friendly service, they yell what I assume are nice things to you in Japanese when you come in and leave.

Expect a pretty long wait since no reservations are taken here", "Positive"], ["Hands down one of my favorite ramen spots ever. My husband and I happened upon this place during one of our visits to Toronto, and the small line at the door piqued our interest. We saw that we had 5 minutes until opening, so we thought, \"why not\", and got in line.We were seated right away (obviously), and saw that they had they had a special Pork Jowl Ramen on their menu. They only make a certain amount of the special each day, and when it's out, it's out. We both ordered the special and to our delight, the noodles and broth came out piping hot, and the toppings were served separately on a side dish. Some people may have found this odd, but we liked it because we were able to control how soaked we wanted the meat to be. We've often gone to ramen shops where the meat has disintegrated due to the high heat of the broth, and high heat can cause the meat to release extra oil into the broth, so if you don't drink it fast, it starts to feel unpleasant as the fat begins to coagulate. The broth was DELICIOUS; the flavors were well rounded, hearty, and so savory. I'm literally salivating as I write this. We fell in love after this meal, and marked it as one of our \"must haves\" whenever we visit Toronto.On our next visit to Toronto, we took my husband's cousin with us. Again, we got to the restaurant before opening and stood in a small line. My husband and his cousin ordered the Pork Jowl Ramen again, but I tried the Tsukemen Ramen this time. The noodles come cooked in a bowl, and your broth is served separately. It was my first time having Tsukemen, and I enjoyed my experience. I was able to dip my noodles, and the broth coated the noodles with flavor. I enjoyed being able to sip the broth without having a ton of noodles rushing toward my mouth as I tipped the bowl toward me. I honestly dream about this place since we don't have an authentic Ramen shop back home, and I was so disappointed when TED was cancelled in Vancouver in 2019 since I was supposed to work the event and was adamant that Hokkaido was going to be my first meal when I landed.I'm looking forward to being able to travel to Canada again in the near future (hopefully) so that I can visit this place again!(I won't be posting any photos since it looks like there's about 50 pictures of the same things that have already been posted)", "Positive"], ["I love Ramen.I think I've been to almost every Ramen shop in Toronto.

TBH, I do not enjoy the dipping ramen though. I also do not like the sour plum they put on one of the ramens because it is too sour, but I know some of my friends like it.The service here is also extremely fast.

Curry chicken with onion pancake (30$)It's a hainan chicken style with a few drops of curry and a poorly done Chinese onion pancake. It barely resembles curry as it's splattered on the dish underneath, and the pancake was lukewarm and hard. Beef roast w/potatoes (30$)By far the best dish. But this is just a Canadian Sunday dinner?

I preferred the chicken over beef. The cod was delicious. Highly recommend. I really enjoyed the pad thai too. I was excited for the turnip cake that came with the cod but unfortunately it wasn't really authentic/ nothing like the ones you get from dim sum. I had high hopes for the curry chicken since it's their award winning dish. It was good, but I wasn't wow'd by it. I got the lychee ginger beer drink and that was delicious. I loved it. We also bought a cake for cutting, I expected a cake cutting fee but it was $60 when we got the bill, which I thought was a bit expensive. The sever mentioned their meals are meant to be shared family style. And suggested one large/main meal would be enough for two people.

This one actually really impressed me- I did not expect it to be that good! The peanut butter taste was not as overwhelming as these types of bars usually are.

Very fresh and light I would probably order it again. That was probably the best part of the meal. The cheeseburger rolls were pretty unique and tasty. I wasn't blown away by the cheeseburger spring roll concept but I wasn't disappointed. The other two courses were mediocre at best. I was very disappointed in the octopus. It lacked flavour, was chewy despite the waiter telling me how it was so tender snd not chewy before I bit into it. Makes me think he also sensed it was over cooked. The chicken on the other hand was cooked perfectly and very juicy. The flavour of the coconut curry was good but not spectacular, It kind of lacked any real wow factor taste wise. Presentation of everything was really nice. A+ for plating the food. Taste though was really lacking on everything but the salad. I have heard great things and my partner had been here before.

The Montreal Benny is spectacular... definitely my favorite of the two and probably one of the best Benedict I've ever had. The Eggsuberant was a classic delicious breakfast and it was exactly what I needed after a night out. The fianc\u00e9 had the western omelette both days... he knows what he likes!The mimosas were made with fresh juice which is always a winner. The prices definitely fit the servings. The French toast was fabulous as well!", "Positive"], ["This was our favorite breakfast and brunch spot to go to while staying in Toronto. The place was live, music was going and drinks kept coming. Was super packed in there but we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The high rise pancakes was so good. Different flavors and textures kept my mouth watering after every bite", "Positive"], ["In Montr\u00e9al I've eaten here dozens of times. Canadians do breakfast right. The best deal (albeit not cheap) is two eggs, potatoes and two pancakes or two French toast and Canadian style turkey bacon. We also had a berry smoothie. The plate is assembled neatly, two eggs are enough even if it doesn't look like much in the plate. The French toast is great, the pancakes were a little burned or overcooked. \u00a0I don't recall a breakfast place burning pancakes before so I told off a star. But normally it should be good. This Bay Street location is also special because there is a oral surgeon located next door and the huge operating room provides a free show! \u00a0See the photo. I guess the patient is too. Frogged up to notice a bunch of people eating while she's getting drilled!", "Positive"], ["I ordered the montreal omelette. It came in a huge portion with lots of fruit and home fries. Everything was okay but I felt the egg was a little overcooked so it had a rubbery texture. I liked the way they added the conadian bacon so it was whole stripes across the egg but it also made it a little difficult to cut into peice when eating", "Positive"], ["Stellar! Food is amazing Pre-pandemic times, I've been once for dine-in and LOVED the experience. Fantastic service, atmosphere and food.During pandemic, I've gotten take-out once and had a good experience as well. Price? Unbeatable. Really great value for what you are served.I've had kamayan feasts from other restaurants, and Tinuno remains one of the best. The ingredients are good and fresh, flavour is on point. Their food is a feast for eyes too. Definitely deserve repeat visits here.The shop also has small grocery items for sale too - so you can pick up pantry items and snacks as well.ProTip: There is no parking nearby for those of us driving to pick-up food... so get to the area early to figure out parking. Or have someone drop you off", "Positive"], ["So yummy!! My two friends and I had the kamayan, split a sinigang soup, and some ube ice cream. Everything was really great, the sinigang, mango salad, shrimp, milkfish, and garlic rice are still in my mind. We got some ube ice cream to top it off (even though we were completely stuffed) and it was nicely flavored, not too sweet. Also reasonably priced and super friendly service! Would recommend to anyone", "Positive"], ["The food and restaurant is the same as what I remembered when my friend and I dined here at Tinuno a few years ago. All we could remember was how dry and rubbery the fish was.. and too much of our surprise, it was still the same food quality as before. Nothing has really changed. I've been advised by many people who have dined here that it isn't the best place for Kamayan feast and there are much better ones in Toronto. However, the price is pretty cheap ($18.95 per person) for the amount of food we had so quantity over quality here. If you pay cash, taxes are excluded. Funny enough, among us five who dined here yesterday, we said that the garlic rice was the only tasty item in this Kamayan feast. It is certainly worth the first try but I wouldn't come back again. I'm looking forward to redeem my Kamayan experience at Casa Manila next week", "Positive"], ["This was a really unique and authentic dining experience. If you could get \u00a0a table in pre-COVID times it was an amazing place to sit and enjoy a really cool meal that you eat with your hands and in a sharing style. The food was also placed with such thought you eat with your eyes first. The eating with your mouth doesn't disappoint at all and I think its really great value for what you receive. The shop is a bit smaller and parking can be difficult to find but I still think this is easily a 10/10 restaurant in the Toronto area", "Positive"], ["My sweetie and I ventured into Toronto's Upper Jarvis / St. James Town neighbourhood for a late traditional Filipino lunch.After paying for Toronto P street parking about 100 metres away, we walked to this old renovated house turned restaurant, which also now shares a common pathway to a health & wellness business upstairs.We waited 10 minutes in the very small corridor, showed our provincial vaccine passports to allow us to dine indoors, and were then seated at a window table (which made us feel safer based on the narrow venue layout).Our server was very courteous & efficiently tending to our dining experience.We ordered the Tinuno signature Kamayan Feast for $18/person. \u00a0It was served on a wooden board loaded with Milkfish (..Tilapia was the other choice), squid, mussels, shrimps, pork belly, BBQ pork, garlic rice, eggplant, okra, slices orange, and mango salad.The beverages selected? \u00a0A can of Coconut Water and a can of Calamansi.What was the dining intrigue? \u00a0No utensils; you're given a pair of thin plastic gloves to feed yourself! \u00a0Wow, I thought this was fascinating.Final thoughts: fresh seafood, excellent service, rice served was harder than our preference, would be nice if Tinuno offered a chicken or beef substitution for pork. \u00a0We will return for another terrific meal!", "Positive"], ["Being part Filipino it was great to visit one of Toronto's few sit-down Filipino restaurants. The menu is filled with signature Pinoy dishes, but if you are here the Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight is the reason for eating sit-down. Not eating it is the equivalent of not getting All-You-Can-Eat at an AYCE Sushi Place, or ordering Ala Carte from a Korean BBQ Place. The food is delicious and reminiscent of authentic Filipino cuisine, which is expected since the staff/chefs are actually Filipino/Filipina. The mussels, chicken/pork, shrimp and other meats are all marinated and cooked to be very moist and the rice and salad are seasoned perfectly. The only downside of the restauraunt is the size. Traditionally Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fights are shared with large families or large groups of friends. At this location its only a small amount of tables which max out at maybe 4-6 people? Because of this its hard to host a large gathering here without having to rearrange pretty much every table in the place. Fortunately they do offer takeout, however it isnt as authentic as the leaf on table servings", "Positive"], ["Tinuno is one of my favourite Filipino food places to visit. I usually order the kamayan, or sinigang. If you decide to check this place out you definitely need to try their sinigang, mango salad, and garlic rice. And for desert try their Ube ice cream. Great service as well! everyone is super friendly", "Positive"], ["I love this place. I've been here a handful of times and even had my birthday here (pre-Covid). The unlimited garlic fried rice is my favourite part. I love eating kamayan style (with your hands) and on banana leaves. The price is also very reasonable for what you get! The staff are so kind and friendly. My parents were born in the Philippines so this was a real treat for them. There's a small room on the second floor which was able to house my large group of 16-18 people for my birthday. I highly recommend this place!", "Positive"], ["The Kamayan feast has always been solid here. My first time here (pre-covid) that bed of garlic rice made such an impression on me. We ordered takeout recently because I had a craving for that delicious meal. The grilled items on the feast were very tasty. But unfortunately the rice on the bottom was cold and started to turn hard. We also ordered the crispy pata (pork hock) and while the skin was crispy, the meat was a bit hard and dry.My rating is partly based on my original dine-in experience. If based on take out, only 3 stars. This type of meal is best enjoyed in store!", "Positive"], ["It was a really cool experience to share with friends. Although the restaurant is small, but since we are sharing the food, we all sat relatively cozily to eat the food off the table with our hands. Food was well seasoned and very flavourful. I had a really enjoyable time trying this out! My favourite is the garlic rice, I wish I could eat it everyday", "Positive"], ["Pizza is amazing, a-little on the pricy side but you do not need much of it to fill you up. Would highly recommend the out Canadian and the jaffna, my personal favourite off the menu", "Positive"], ["Back in the day when I would go to NYC twice a year just to eat pizza I would long for that desired mouthfeel, the fresh tomato sauce and the char on the bottom of the pizza. And that brings me to Detroit... style?? Although better than the deep dish in the CHI (lou malnatis. UNO) we have a contender for the best pizza in Toronto. A 30-60 minute wait for four/eight slices (S/L) will have you coming back for more. Having tried the pepperoni and no name, the burnt thick crust edges, crisping hard complimented by the fresh tangy tomato sauce and whatever toppings you may have on your pie leave you coming back for more. There's something about these thick slices that make me want to try every single one of these (maybe not the Canadian and veggie option). 5/5", "Positive"], ["Definitely worth a try.A special occasion treat, enough for two for dinner despite the size because it's thickness and density is quite filling.We got the No Name pizza which had great topping, except for the ricotta which was a bit too thick and wet.Highly recommended", "Positive"], ["Hands down the best pizza my partner and I have ever tried in our lives - the crust was mind blowing. We've tried a couple of flavours but No-Name and the Truff-ghi are to write to every single one of your friends and family about!! (the Barese was good but not life changing). Best dip for this is the hot honey.Definitely more on the pricey side but the quality is very worth it for special occasions or if you just want to have the best comfort night in", "Positive"], ["I ordered in advance through the phone for pick up and was told it would take about 35-45 minutes.. when i got there around 30 minutes it was already done.. time accuracy is pretty important because of limited parking in the hustle and bustle of queen street.I ordered a small which was about $22 before tax.. definitely on the pricey side but the pizza in itself is thick (filling) but not too heavy. The outer crust is nice and crispy and the dough is soft with a light chew.. toppings were perfect (not too much and not too little).Cant wait to go back and try another flavour but when Im ready to indulge", "Positive"], ["Wow so glad I got to try this pizza.Got the electric and the funghi pizza. BOTH are very good. The funghi is slightly better but damn, they make some good pizza!!!We ordered at 6pm and the wait was 2 hours. When we got it, it was steaming hot. It may look like deep dish but it's not. Majority is fluffy airy crunchy pizza bread. More carbs is the best, I say! Lots of toppings and so it was the perfect combo for me. And. So. Worth. The. Wait", "Positive"], ["First time trying Detroit-style pizza and it's pretty special. If I could describe it, it's like marrying focaccia and pizza dough together and Descendant makes a killer pizza.We ordered take-out and had a great experience with the staff, super friendly! Truff-ghi - loaded with a ton of mushrooms, cheesy and a nice balance with the creamy truffle sauce and caramelized onion for a bit of sweetness Jaffna - good amount of heat (not too spicy), definitely a unique flavour with a punch of indian flavour and a load of spicesBoth flavours were great and every bite had a load of ingredients and flavour! The crust had a super crisp exterior and nice and pillowy interior. Also love how they fill the toppings right to the edge of the pizza!I will say it is a bit pricey, the small is ~$20 for four slices but definitely worth it!", "Positive"], ["Really greasy and I loved it Surprisingly very filling even just 1 slice was very heavy", "Positive"], ["MY FAVOURITE PIZZA PLACE! I only had it once at my sister's baby shower and I've been wanting to go back ever since. Their TRUFF-GHI pizza is so good!

We ordered the small sized \"Truff-ghi\" pizza which has: cheese blend, slow-roasted garlic cremini mushrooms, caramelized onions, double-smoked bacon, white truffle sauce and then some.These pizzas are all made to order so be sure to call ahead! They were precise with the (long) 1 hr pick up time quoted which meant it came hot and fresh out the oven. For the small-ish size of the box, it was pretty heavy! The dough was cheesy and surprisingly crunchy, the inside was soft and fluffy and loaded with toppings and a generous portion of sauce. All the toppings complemented each other well, with the caramelized onions adding a hint of sweetness, and the truffle sauce adding aroma. However, I did wish the truffle aroma was stronger and to improvise, I added a few drops of white truffle oil on top, and it was a GAMECHANGER Even for those with a big appetite like me, having 2 of the 4 slices in the small sized pie was super filling. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, this deserves serious brownie points!", "Positive"], ["Pretty small shop on the corner of the street but everyone should take notice. I love their hand pulled noodles with the super soft braised beef. The soup itself is nicely flavoured but not overpowering. It's just a vehicle for the delicious noodles and meat. It's also a very reasonable price for what you get. My co-worker and I come here often because of how affordable it is. It's a pretty small an popular spot so come a little earlier in case their is a line", "Positive"], ["GB Hand-pulled noodles is incredible! You get the full experience of seeing them making the noodles and BANGING them on the table. This is a great lunch spot for me and my co-workers. We typically come 30 minutes before the lunch rush to avoid how busy it could get. Overall the flavour of the soup is excellent, you can choose the type of noodles to get, and best of all, add as much chilli oil as you want", "Positive"], ["I liked the size of the soup portion, it was HUGE! And the food was tasty and hot enough to cry even for the medium spicy:)", "Positive"], ["Value for money noodlesService: The staff are friendly, they check your temperature before you walk in and you write down your information for contact-tracing. Food:Ordered a mega bowl of lanzhou noodles, one of two in our group. It's definitely a huge bowl, big enough for two people to share, but the ratio of the beef and other ingredients (radish, cilantro) seemed to be off and it was just a lot of soup and noodles. Ended up finishing it solo, but it was definitely a struggle at the end, would recommend getting a large for one, or mega with extra beef if sharing. The noodle texture was nice and springy/chewy, you can customize the thickness and you can see they pull the noodles by hand inside. The broth was on the lighter side, but the chili oil helped flavour it. Also had the cucumber and jelly fish and the flavours were spicy and tangy, spot on!Overall: Good spot if you're craving hand-pulled noodles", "Positive"], ["this is the perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat. the service is friendly and fast. I personally love any type of noodle soup and if you add hand pulled noodles...well that is just the cherry on top. this soup is savory and light but still has a deep beef flavor. I like the chili oil added on top and asked for extra scallion for garnish. I got the regular/small size which has 5 slices of thinly sliced beef on top of extra wide noodles. the chew on the noodles is amazing. I think in hindsight I would go for wide noodles instead.I'm sad I was only visiting and couldn't try more of the menu but this was the perfect place for my last brunch!", "Positive"], ["Some of the best food I've ever had. \u00a0Love Vietnamize. \u00a0Ambiance was top notch and service even better", "Positive"], ["Came here with a friend on a Thursday night.

The delivery experience though not as good is still great to try.The beef noodle soup came separate and you had to mix it together. Disappointed I had no choice of the type of noodle I wanted. Tasted just like the dine in experience however. Just ensure you get fast delivery so you can eat it hot!I also got the roasted pork ribs. Didn't really seem \"roasted\" but tasted good regardless and got a big portion size which I was happy about.Soups are hard to get perfect via delivery, however GB Hand Pulled noodles comes close. I'd recommend the beef noodle soup if you are reading this", "Positive"], ["Tucked away at the north east corner of Edward St and Bay St is GB Noodles. The restaurant has adapted during covid19 with their patio area, which is an extension on the sidewalk and not dangerously on the street (like some other restaurants). Takeout seems to be the popular choice and the ordering counter is now right at the door. Ordering is fast and efficient. I understand that the noodles are the star of the show, but I wish there were more topping options. I pretty much saw either minced pork or slices of beef. Also some veggies (like bok choy) would be a \u00a0nice addition. There's a wide variety of noodle thickness and I went for an order of thick and thin. I agree with some reviewers that thick noodles give it a bit more texture and chewiness. But I prefer the thin noodles. The soup is clear and generally is smooth tasting, with a bite as a finish - an acquired taste.Overall, not bad and I did appreciate the noodles. However there are many noodle options in Toronto nowadays and I'm likely to rather give a new place a try.Thanks GB Noodles for the tasty lunch!", "Positive"], ["Noodles are fresh.

I bet it would taste even better fresh with crunchy fries", "Positive"], ["One of the best taco places in Toronto. Their carne Asada and beef bulgogi tacos are the best!

Nestled in the King Street corridor, their Ritual pick up is super smooth - very efficient grab and go. Food is 4.5 stars: tacos are a sophisticated set of flavours that tickle the pallet (order at least 3 if hungry) and their steak fajitas are tasty too. Limited seating on the patio so plan ahead.

Perfect for a casual friend meet-up", "Positive"], ["My favourite place for sizzling steak fajitas. I missed the hot plates so much during the lockdown.

I first did my visit up to the tower as a kid. \u00a0It's definitely better as a grown up.

Woo! I watched my cousin did it from down below. It's like space needle but 3 times taller!! (1800+ ft) It's \u00a0also one of the 9th tallest free standing structures. Views are stunning from above.

There's another elevator you can take higher for an extra $15 with may be nice for sunset in a clear day. They have an edge walk that seems super cool. For $195 per person you can put on a jump suit and walk around the outside edge. The restaurant is the best bang for your buck. You need a reservation! It's $75 for a two course meal in a high end restaurant. The food was exceptional and the service was professional, kind, and attentive. Best of all you get free access to the observation area after dinner but you don't need it as the restaurant is spinning and right above the deck.The aquarium, train museum, Fairmont Hotel, and c stadiums are all within walking distance.

From the moment we passed security, we were greeted with nothing but friendly smiles, and we knew that we were in for a treat. Once we got up to the restaurant, we were quickly brought to our seats, and were in awe at the view. We went at night, so seeing all the glistening lights across the GTA was truly a treat. The entire vibe was very romantic, and perfect for couples. Food - 9/10I got an appetizer of Steamed PEI Mussels and a main of lamb. The serving of mussels was very generous, and they provide a few pieces of bread with it to soak up the sauce at the bottom of the pot, which was a very nice touch. The lamb was incredibly tender, and cooked perfectly! Service - 9/10Service was phenomenal, and we were treated so well. If I wanted to be extremely nit-picky, the only flaw throughout the entire night was that we waited for ~10 minutes to get the bill after we asked for it.

I really enjoys the seafood platter come with lobster, crab, mussels, oysters, shrimps, and scallop. The 8oz tenderloin steak with mash potatoes was cool to perfection.

All sandwiches come with 2 sauces (free) and toppings for .95. While I do wish that toppings were just included in the price, I didn't mind paying extra because the sandwich is incredible. I ordered the Pulled BBQ pork shoulder with the Black Camel BBQ Saucr and the Charamoula Mayo. This combo of sauces was TO DIE FOR!! I would come back for the sauces alone.

Looking forward to try the steak sandwich next time I'm around", "Positive"], ["I got the beef brisket sandwich. Super packed with flavour. However, the buns were damp from condensation in the packaging by the time we started eating (which was maybe 5 min after getting the sandwiches). Sandwich looked squished and was very greasy and messy. Overall...not the best experience. This was made worse since we were eating in the car (we figured we should just eat ASAP rather than wait to get home). It was like eating a sandwich that was trying to live up to the restaurant's reputation of being flavourful and really good, but sadly wasn't making the cut. Lots of sauce dribbling off from the insides though miraculously the beef brisket itself didn't fall out (which was good). My fingers still had sauce on them after wiping off the mess with a napkin and two wet wipes. Despite the somewhat disappointing experience, I'm willing to give this place another chance. Definitely going to get a different order - something that won't be as squishy or messy", "Positive"], ["I'm not sure if this place is under new ownership, but the quality and quantity of my last sandwich (beef brisket) was way lower than I expected. There was much less meat in the sandwich than I have ever had before. It tasted fine, but I won't be going back until things change. PS. To the earlier reviewer. Toronto loves lines? That's dumb", "Positive"], ["Decent, but I don't get the hype.Clearly solid ingredients well made, tho bread was \u00a0not stellar, but honestly, to my palette, I was not blown away.Yet, Toronto loves lines and this place provides. Prepare to line up and wait.Not bad, just I don't get they hype", "Positive"], ["Great place for a tasty sandwich, you can choose your own flavours but any combination ends up being pretty tasty as the meat and vegetables are fresh and tasty", "Positive"], ["I have been dreaming of going back to Black camel to eat their beef brisket sandwich again.This sandwich is da-bomb!!!!I had gone here just before they were closing and it was raining too.The place was empty and I did get to chat with the girl behind the counter-I asked her for her suggestion and without taking any time she recommended the beef brisket sandwich.So you build your sandwich-the process is quite uncomplicated-you pick a meat, your sauces and toppings.After the first or second topping they charge you for for additional topping pls check the menu.My order was the brisket wIth charamoula mayo topped with carmalized onions and coleslaw.I took it to go.I took my first bite in the car and boy oh boy the beef just melted in my mouth the flavors were on point and the quality of meat was amazing.The sauce did full justice plus the toppings.Eating the sandwich in the car was not a great idea \u00a0as it can become very messy \u00a0but I could g hold off since it was amazingly good and it would totally get soggy if I had waited.The best thing about it was the less sodium used in the beef brisket-felt like I was eating a homemade beef brisket sandwich.Parking could be a challenge here", "Positive"], ["Solid sandwiches with very high quality ingredients! Excellent service - fast and friendly!", "Positive"], ["Few weeks back I stopped in to Black Camel for Lunch. I have heard from a few friends that the sandwiches here are to die for. I opted to try the Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Sandwich. This was no small sandwich. The size was bigger than I expected for the price. Only $8.75 and you had a large kaiser roll full of tender goodness. You got a choice of two sauces and I went with the in house Black Camel BBQ sauce and the Chiptole Mayo. The meat was super tender and melted in your mouth. Paired with the two sauces made it slightly messy but well worth it. I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches on the menu. If your near Rosedale station and are hungry stop in at Black Camel you won't be disappointed", "Positive"], ["Came by with my girlfriend to pick up a drink before our event. When we got into the store front, there weren't anyone to greet us. Which felt odd. Anyhow, we ordered a latte and after a short wait the drink came out. It tasted amazing, with strong aromatics and great flavour. Service wise, it's just okay. Nothing worth to note", "Positive"], ["Great for tapas and standing or seated, drinking with friends. Interior is very cool - artistic and all wooden convex / concave architecture. Ambiance is just right", "Positive"], ["I have heard of this place for several years, but only had a chance to try their takeout food recently. The portion was relatively small and pricy, but with decent quality of food provided with some highlights there. Their bakeries and cold dishes were especially amazing.My favourite dishes from the order:- Sourdough loaf: Why is the bread dish worth mentioning? Because it was bigger than my face and so chewy and flavourful.- Basque cake: They provided us with clear heat-at-home instructions and it tasted soooo delicious and not overwhelming me with its sweetness level. I wished the portion was slightly larger though because we couldn't have enough.- Mixed plate 4 pack: This included two types of cheese and sausage. Both sausages were so delicious and were gone in ten minutes. The Mountain oak Gouda cheese (cow cheese) was my personal favorite, with slightly stronger than medium flavour. My husband preferred the lighter Manchego cheese (sheep cheese). The cheese goes really well with the sourdough loaf. Worth a try.Now some hot dishes:- Charred octopus: We are a fan of octopus, so would almost order octopus dish everywhere we can. This was overall an average dish. The sauce was really good but the octopus was too hard. I would recommend dipping the sauce with the sourdough loaf though.- Asparagus salad: It was cooked well with its highlights being the strong scent of the Marcona almonds. This was a good dish but not wowing me.In general, I would like to revisit this place when they are reopening for dining in", "Positive"], ["Love their cake. Came here for a birthday dinner and was surprised by the good quality! Pretty expensive tho", "Positive"], ["Amazingggggg Tapas here. The standouts were the Shrimp, Snow pea leaves, and the Mushrooms!!! THE MUSHROOMS...Absolute flavour bombs and crispy. \u00a0I highly recommending ordering their classic bread and olive oil too, it was nice together BUT even better if you use the bread to dip with the Shrimp dish's sauces and chili oil!! Other notable tapas we tried was the Ceviche. It was almost like a guac but the fish was plentiful and fresh with the in house chips (seasoned with paprika too!). The Tomato bread was alright.Atmosphere felt super European. Especially since we came during the COVID outdoor patio season, their street side tiny tables for 2 set up was very minimal and Chic. It was a pricey meal but a lovely treat once in a while", "Positive"], ["Food is delicious even tho it's on the more pricy side, we really liked the grilled octopus. The downside is the fixed 20% tip, especially they charge the tax on top of the tip which makes no sense to me", "Positive"], ["The service was wonderful! There was a 30 min wait for patio seating. The hostess suggested us to go chill at the park until our table is ready. They couldn't contact me, so the hostess walked all the way to the park to let us know our table will be ready in 5 minute. THANK YOU! What we ordered: Roasted bone marrowGrill octopus Prosciutto ( Jamon iberico de bellota) Grilled picanha steak The food was amazing! I will definitely come back when I visit Toronto again", "Positive"], ["This spot is definitely the best Spanish restaurant in Toronto!My absolute favourites include: The shaved foie gras on a baguette. So rich, buttery and full of flavour! The octopus, which is their most popular dish, is always cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The iberico chorizo is also amazing, bite sized and so buttery it melts in your mouth Cozy vibe, great food and attentive service! What more could you ask for!", "Positive"], ["Came here for Valentine's day dinner with my boyfriend. Let's just say this place was on my list of restaurants I wanted to try since time. I'm a huge fan of Grant van Gameren. The vibe outside reminds me of a tavern you'd come across in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. Inside is just as romantic with dim red mood lighting. It's very romantic. We chose to do the set menu however, we didn't realize how much food was coming out. We weren't that hungry but we said what the heck. We told them we just definitely wanted to try the Octopus (pulpo is my favourite!).First course was the charcuterie and cheese with bread - I wasn't a huge fan of smoked meat or meat that looks raw but I gave it a chance and it went well with the cheese. Second course was the shishito peppers - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish as I've had really delicious shishito peppers in Madrid and this couldn't compare. I wish it was a bit more charred and crispy.Third course was the Sweetbread and raw tuna - two things that I normally do not eat but I wanted to be adventurous and sucked it up. This dish was surprisingly really tasty with great contrasting textures. The less you think about what sweetbreads are the better it began to taste haha..Fourth course was the ceviche - another dish that i normally do not eat since I generally don't eat raw fish but the flavours here were done very well and the fish was fried so crispy and used as a bowl to house the ceviche which i thought was very clever. By this course we were so full that we couldn't finish the ceviche. We also didn't finish the first course too.Fifth course was the octopus - I feel bad saying this but perhaps it was my high expectations but I had better octopus at Ricardo's. However, it was still very tasty though.Sixth course was the mushrooms - omg to die for. I can't believe after all these courses the mushrooms took the cake! It was the best mushrooms I've ever had. I would go back just for the mushrooms (not even for the octopus!) which speaks volumes.We ended off our night with the dessert courses...Seventh course - THE BASQUE CAKE - probably one of the simplest but most scrumptious desserts I've ever had. Would also come back just for the basque cake. Eighth and last course - ice cream bars covered in chocolate. This was basically like a tiny mini version of a Klondike bar. I wasn't impressed. Overall, I don't know if it was just a mix of my high expectations and the fact that I decided to be adventurous and got that basically handed to me with everything I don't usually eat. But I feel like I've had a better experience with a tasting menu at DaiLo but I gave it a try and the food here was really well done. That, paired with the vibes of this place, it's so romantic and a perfect date spot. However, quite pricey and be ready to spend a couple hundred dollars especially if you're ordered drinks (which we did)", "Positive"], ["I finally got a chance to try the infamous Bar Isabel (took me a while)! I made reservations for a Saturday night knowing that it was going to be slammed and boy, did it get packed the later it got!The restaurant wasn't as packed as I thought it would be but boy, was it dim in there? I'm not those diners who would turn on their phone flash light to read the menu but I wouldn't blame you if we did. The menu was pretty much entirely in Spanish but there were definitely a few winners. The Roasted Bone Marrow - Creamy, fatty and delicious. They do it so well here and I know they have this in most restaurants but get it here as well.Shrimp al Ajillo - This was the highlight of my meal actually, not the Grilled Octopus. The shrimp that they used were the giant red shrimps from Argentina so they were very meaty and juicy. I had my first one in La Banane and was mind-blown. These were cooked in a rich butter garlic sauce, and yes they were amazing.Basque Cake - I would come back just for this. You simply cannot go for a meal a Bar Isabel and not order the Basque Cake. It was like a cookie scented cake bathed in a thick and creamy sherry sauce. It may not look photogenic but ORDER IT", "Positive"], ["Had an absolutely wonderful dinner here recently. We were seated away from the crowd so it was lovely quiet relaxed experience. Started with the Flat Earth cocktail which was delicious while being mostly a savoury drink. It was well balanced and mixed so it did not feel too heavy or strange. For food, we had the bread, oysters, octopus, tuna mojama, half service of the jamon tasting, veal sweetbreads and raw tuna, and chorizo verde. Every single dish had its unique flavours and textures which complimented each other while bringing different experiences to the table. A table favorite was the sweetbreads because every flavour and texture could be found on a single dish. The chorizo verde was so tender, full of herbs and is the first ever sausage I would describe as light. The octopus was perfectly tender. The butter sauce that it came with was too salty for my tastes, but it went well with the hearty sour bread. Absolutely lovely meal!! Definitely a great treat!!", "Positive"], ["Wow I never had this pork belly bao that incorporates the outside Chinese style bao white bun. \u00a0That's a twist.....delicious. \u00a0Nice layer of pork belly. \u00a0This is affordable and relatively quick to get. \u00a0Yummy and it won't break the bank", "Positive"], ["A pretty staple Vietnamese sandwich spot - plenty of great selections, but the kalbi beef is definitely my favourite. It's topped with cucumber, carrot, cilantro, classic Asian BBQ sauce, and kimchi. Add some sriracha for a perfect kick!", "Positive"], ["This place is a Vietnamese fusion to go banh mi joint. I got the pork and my husband got the chicken (both extra spicy which means sriracha and fresh jalape\u00f1os...the jalape\u00f1os were actually spicy!). Service is fast and the sandwiches are large. They have a great selection of drinks. I got the Mr. coffee and my hubby got a san Pellegrino. I thought the banh mis were fine and got the job done for a quick lunch. We did get a octopus taco, which was not good or fresh. So, I would stick to meats if you go here. To be fair, I don't love fusion food and it looked like other customers got the baos (so maybe those are better?)", "Positive"], ["Amazing banh mi!! I was starving but also, I think I can probably live on this everyday Little shop at the intersection. Close to college park where you can eat. Indoor dining area isn't big -- maybe 3-4 tables?Would recommend if you want some reasonably healthy but still juicy and good lunch options ~", "Positive"], ["This spot is in the middle of everything yet hard to find maybe due to it's black colored board. We ordered 4 Fried Chicken steamed baos 2 Hot- Jalape\u00f1os which tasted sweet and 2 Medium hot - sriracha sauce was ok but a little more sauce would have been perfect. If you like hot and spicy stuff like south asian people my recommendation is to go with medium hot - sriracha sauce and ask them to double the sauce and viol\u00e0...Can't complaint about the chicken as it was so tender and crispy to perfection. Best thing about Bahn Mi Boys Baos are they all come with some sort of veggies which gives them a healthy touch", "Positive"], ["A nice stroll at the heart of yonge dundas one will see this amazing restaurant. It's a very nice, quiet, and serene place. Would love to come again", "Positive"], ["First time trying first time trying this location. It's as good as the Queen street and Spadina location. \u00a0Had the grilled pork banh mi and it did not disappoint. \u00a0Ordered it spicy (with jalape\u00f1o) and found that it could have been more spicy but still tasty nonetheless. Ordered regular fries and it was enough to share for two people. \u00a0Would definitely be back again", "Positive"], ["That 5 spice pork meat and the fried chicken meat are BOMB!! They have a variety of other meats I wish I got the chance to try- all range from $7 or so for the banh mis, which is pricier but worth the taste. Mayo adds to hold both the banh mi and the bao together. I think the meat is really what makes it no matter what you get. Got it to go because they close at 10pm, went there around 9:37pm and they were closing up. See pics for menu", "Positive"], ["Thank god for Banh Mi Boys.I come here once a week for lunch. The place is a little dirty as most of the staff is behind the counter and lunch time gets hectic.My favorites to order:1. Deep-fried Chicken Bao: finally, I can enjoy a bao without pork! The sauces here are similar to a banh mi but not quite. The veggies they use are delicious and really add to the flavor. The bao is always soft and warm. Very filling.2. Sweet Potato Fries: The portions are huge. The fries always seem a little burnt but still good. A little oily but crispy.These 2 things fill me up for under $10. TIP: Order on Ritual!", "Positive"], ["Banh Mi Boys is one of my fav places to grab a quick bite with friends, they even have some awesome vegetarian options. I have probably visited this location over a dozen times, and they never disappoint. The staff here are always great, and they are fast even when the place is packed! There is maybe about 8 tables to sit-down at, so be prepared to grab take-out if there isn't any seats. I've tried their Banh Mi sandwiches, Baos and Tacos and they are all so delectable! The Duck Confit Banh Mi sandwich is probably my favourite, with the 5 Spice Pork Belly Bao following shortly behind. And I would recommend ALWAYS order the Kimchi Fries! They are probably the best side you could ever ask for. So if you're ever in the area and want a good quick bite that you won't hate yourself for, skip the McDonald's and walk down to Banh Mi Boys!", "Positive"], ["Sooooo good. Great atmosphere, food taste good.. the gin sonic is to die for. Watch out, that drink will sneak up in you! I will definitely be going back", "Positive"], ["I was looking for a good izakaya spot in Toronto and was really glad to find this spot. The udon were sooooo good highly highly recommend. We got both the beef and the kimchi and love love love both. Unfortunately we had to drive back to London right after so we did not try the drinks, but will definitely for our next visit!", "Positive"], ["I'm not sure how to rate this. 4/5 stars pre-COVID because everything I ordered was amazing and the menu selection was huge. But I came once indoor dining was open and the menu was considerably condensed. The explanation was a lot of the items were not in season (like the baked oyster with cheese, almond tofu dessert). And a lot of my favourite items weren't there. I guess with COVID, ingredient prices have gone up but I feel like the whole reason I enjoyed kinka in the past was the wide variety of flavourful items. Anyways, today we ordered the ebimayo deep fried shrimp, takoyaki, takowasabi, karaage, salmon & scallop pressed sushi, special items menu. Things I'd order again: takowasabi - strong wasabi flavour and a classic nose punch burn. Very flavourful. Yummy). \u00a0Aburi buta bara (grilled pork belly with garlic sauce) - nice smoky bbq taste. Good flavour. Tokyo fry (French fries with garlic mayo)- mc Donald's like French fries. Tasty. Nama grapefruit cocktail- you get to squeeze your own grapefruit. Picturesque. Tasty!Things that coasted in the middle:Salmon oshizushi (blow torched pressed salmon sushi)- salmon was tasty but the rice a little too mushy but held it's shape. Things I wouldn't order again:salmon nattoyukke (salmon sashimi/seaweed/onsen tamago)- the lightly cooked sunny side up egg mixed with the salmon sashimi seaweed salad just didn't suit my taste buds at all. I found it very unappealingly bland. My least favorite dish of the night. Kamo tataki (sous vide duck breast)- okay taste but dry. Hotate oshizushi (pressed scallop sushi)- bland Karaage - nothing special. Ebi mayo - all I could taste was fried batter doused in mayo. And I'm sad because I swear this used to be one of my favourites. Batter was quite thick. Takoyaki- good texture but the sauce was overly ketchup-y. Overpowered the overall taste. My server was nice and I enjoy whenever they greet you upon entry. I look forward to the day they bring back their usual menu that I loved so much. I'll update my review then", "Positive"], ["A great late night spot for snacks and drinks! I had a reservation for four, late on a Saturday night. I really enjoyed their Lychee Mojito cocktails, and I put in numerous Salmon Oshizushi orders. I think the best sharing snacks though were the okonomiyaki pancake and takoyaki, both of those orders were well loved by our table. Service was good, our waitress definitely gave our table some space and time between orders, and we didn't feel rushed or timed during our stay. Kinka Izakaya is a fantastic spot for post-pandemic catch-up and drinks, and I highly recommend them for large groups or parties!", "Positive"], ["Slow service. Waited almost 40 mins for our food. Finally had to ask the waiter, and it had been sitting on the counter the entire time waiting to be picked up. They were more concerned about the Uber Eats/take out orders than the customers that were actually in the restaurant. Wish I could give them 0 stars", "Positive"], ["We ordered Uber eats for their 3 course meal as their website was down and not accepting my credit card :( The food and portions at their locations are excellent - they definitely hold the same standard of service. I really appreciated them punching holes into the Karaage box so steam can escape and reduce chances of sogginess. The pieces of chicken were large and lightly battered. A lemon wedge to reduce the oiliness also came along the mayo dip. Their bentos are really filling and has a good variety of meats, and side dishes including tamagoyaki, bamboo shoots, tomato, spinach. I genuinely hope that Kinka stays afloat as I'd love to celebrate another exciting and lively birthday/drinking session with friends. Definitely missing the izakaya atmosphere", "Positive"], ["Lively spot for drinks and tapas. Love the gong haha. Food is good and the vibe is fun", "Positive"], ["I used to like this place because of the Japanese vibes, good service and a variety of food menus.I know we're in difficult situation, however the menu was too simplified and no more interesting menus. The servers never checked on us, giving us kind of attitudes, never say thank you when we were leaving(the serevers were just chatting). The Japanese servers were all gone and I did not feel like this is the same place I used to come", "Positive"], ["Very cool place to hangout with friends. The food quality is very good. It is a loud place and if you want to have a convo it is not a good choice haha", "Positive"], ["I came here with a group of friends mainly for their kinkalicious $29.99 set meal special and was slightly disappointed for a number of reasons: 1. The noise. I've been to the Yonge location before and thought it was a good level of excitement. I did see a lot of the warning reviews for this location but wasn't expecting that level of noise. It's not a good exciting type of noise, but the kind where you have to yell to talk and constantly repeat yourself. It gets super loud with the sake bombs- it's only (kinda) nice when you're the ones doing them. They shake these tin sounding things and it pierces your ears. 2. The service was not impressive. We had to ask our server for refills of water. Also, after the 6th course she asked if we were ready for dessert before we received our bibimbap. After we asked about it, she told us that the kinkalicious doesn't come with the bibimbap, as it only applies to their regular set meal. We pulled out the menu and showed her. I don't get how a server can't know their own menu to that extent, especially when the kinkalicious is such a huge special going on. Had we just took her word for it, we would have been skimped out on the most filling dish... 3. They ran out of matcha ice cream. We were finishing off our dinner around 9.. maybe that's a bit late but when any restaurant runs out of a main component it def doesn't impress me. Especially when they have a special going on, they should prepare and overstock to ensure there will be more than enough to meet demand. 4. They didn't allow us to split bills... just the full bill for the table. This is super inconvenient when you're coming in a group, let alone a large group. 5. For the set meal, they don't serve the dishes individually. They bring you dishes and say \"this serves 2/3\" and you have to figure out how to divvy it up yourselves. This isn't ideal unless you have a s/o to partner up with... considering you're paying an individual price per person, it would be nice to get individual portions. Those unimpressive points aside, the food was okay. The set meal is a cool experience because you get to try things you might not normally try. Izakaya foods are typically on the pricier size for the portions you get... but personally I wouldn't pay the normal $35/person for the set meal, as I was still kind of hungry after. Overall, I much prefer the Yonge location because the atmosphere and noise level is more reasonable there", "Positive"], ["Wonderful experience dining here. Wish I had more people to eat with. I was too greedy and ordered meal for 3-4 people instead of the 2 people. Should have known better than to underestimate portions at a Chinese restaurant! My boyfriend said the staff took the lobster/crab out to show the size and let you know it's fresh. Soup-was filled with ingredients. Light, great flavor and perfect to start off the meal with. Lobster-default is HK style. It's definitely Instagram worthy how they present it. It comes with fries on the bottom. The fries weren't crispy as I would like. It was good to try this as I've never had lobster cooked like this before but I would prefer simple steamed/boiled lobster instead. Crab-simply steamed with side of Chinese wine to dip. We weren't a fan of the wine as we don't drink so asked for butter instead for dipping bassBass-my favorite item of the meal! Fried to perfection. Sauce on the side paired nicely with the fish. Snow peas- this is my favorite veggie at Chinese restaurant. Cooked and flavored well! Macarons- pretty standard macaron. I personally would have preferred oranges or sago to complete the whole Chinese food experience. This restaurant would be great for larger parties! Service on point and food is high quality!", "Positive"], ["I was quite excited to go here because everyone seems to be raving about it - well maybe in the past. We had a huge table of 16 total and I was not impressed at all. The two stars is because the food was not bad at all and that's pretty much the only good thing during our experience here. Below were the reasons for low rating. Service - I've never felt so rushed in a restaurant. I've been to many many Chinese restaurants, my husband is Chinese so we often go to different ones with the family (not Congee Queen/Wong). We had a limit of 2hrs, my in-law said to ensure we arrive on time. We arrived 5mins late, 3 dishes were out already. In the end they cleared it asap, I wasn't fully done but my dishes were taken away already. Washroom - This restaurant is insanely pricey, but they can't afford hot water? Hand washing with cold water is not pleasant. Rings of yellow gunk on top of the toilet, so disgusting. Who does the cleaning? Price - The most we've spent at a restaurant was about $600. We ordered the lobster, king crab, soup, sweet and sour pork, noodles, fish, vegetables = $1400. No problem, paid, but that rush in the end.. they really could care less about customers who spend a lot. They just want you to pay up and get out. I think this paragraph should just be together under service. In addition, the lobster and crab that they pulled out was when we arrived at 5:35, then the lobster/crab dish came out at 5:50. I don't cook, but that was quick to prepare all those dishes... Anyways no I will not be going back here. There are other restaurants with better services, cleaner washrooms, and less cost", "Positive"], ["Surprisingly this is my first visit to Fishmans which is a staple in the Chinese community and probably the most known. People usually come here for large gatherings and celebrations so their party can help finish the gigantic lobster towers lolWe had their 10lb lobster and king crab set. The flavours on the crab were good, however I felt the lobster flavour didn't penetrate into the meat.I found the rest of the food besides the seafood to be just okay. Ex their fried rice, veggies and sweet and sour pork. I think this is a good spot to go if you're strictly craving seafood/shellfish and want that to be the main focus of your meal. I however prefer to have it as a complementI found the service was pretty mediocre which is typical for Chinese restaurants", "Positive"], ["What an amazing place!! This was on my list as a \"must try\" when I was in Toronto. \u00a0I made reservation for early afternoon on a weekday. \u00a0When I first got there, they could not find my reservation, but it was not peak time, so it was not as busy, so they seated me right away. \u00a0The restaurant itself was huge and it was really nice inside. \u00a0There are lobster tanks all around the restaurant. \u00a0I wanted to try both the lobster tower (which was the reason why I wanted to come to Fishman) and the crab. \u00a0The waitress suggested that I get the combo, which had a few other items. \u00a0It was a way better deal to do this, so I decided on this option.The food came out relatively quickly and OMG, it was so delicious:1. Corn soup - It was pretty chilly that day, so the soup was really good as an appetizer. 2. Lobster Tower - I got the HK style lobster tower. \u00a0I thought this would be a let down, but it exceeded my expectation. \u00a0The lobster was fresh and the seasoning was so good! The fries made it a nice touch to eat with the lobster. 3. Crab tower - Not as voluminous as the lobster tower, but also one of my favorite dishes. \u00a0I really enjoyed the sauce on the crab and it was super easy to eat. 4. Garlic crab - This was probably my least favorite of the combo. \u00a0I thought that the garlic sauce was a little bland.5. Crab Fried Rice - Really good rice and plenty of crab in the riceThis combo also came with a veggie, but I was too full to try any. \u00a0The veggie came out last, so I was pretty full by then. \u00a0Just writing this review makes me crave the food again. \u00a0I am definitely putting this on my must try when I am in Toronto again", "Positive"], ["Came here with my family to celebrate. We got the lunch set for 3.

We wanted add fried rice to our order and he suggested us to go with an option of using the king crabs tomalley for fried rice instead. \u00a0Glad we went with that because none of us would have the tomalley on its own.Shortly after my order was taken one of their staff will bring out the shellfish's out to you in a large plastic bin.

Kudos to the chef.The HK lobster was served in a massive tower assembled with precison and \u00a0topped with spicy French fries which is a first. My last visit there it was served with lots of fried garlic chips. We still enjoyed the lobster however I prefer the large garlic chips!Poached Snow pea leaves with goji berries provided some greens to balance out the protein buster meal.Overall decent experience. \u00a0I would like the servers to provide more attentive service to all tables.

Make sure you come hungry", "Positive"], ["I always go to the Fishman Lobster when I'm craving lobster and when\u00a0my mom has time to take me there, and you know what? They were the catalysts for my love of seafood. I'd never touched a crab or lobster until Fishman Lobster, but they'd definitely helped me to broaden my horizons.I love the Hong Kong-style lobsters, and eating them with the gloves they provide is a lot of fun.The pricing is also fairly affordable, since with the lobsters and the amount you're paying for, you get\u00a0additional meals like soup, veggies, deep fried oysters, fried rice, and so on.There is also a complimentary dessert at the end where they offer macarons, which may be a little disappointing at times, but that isn't really my main concern really.This restaurant is ideal for family reunions, school reunions, or just for anybody who craves lobster.Overall, I'll return to this place anytime I have a craving for lobster, as I have for the previous years", "Positive"], ["A classic fave for our family! We always visit this restaurant for special occasions because we absolutely love their lobster and crab towers. It's definitely a fun experience if you want to take any friends and family. Their interior decor is also very beautiful and their service is very quick. We found that Fishman's price for lobster and crab per pound is relatively cheaper than other Chinese restaurants while their quality/flavour is also far better. Our go-to for takeout is a 5 lb Maggi style lobster, we also do the $10 add-on option in which you get e-fu noodles and snow pea leaves", "Positive"], ["\"73 Billion Served\" - a sign above the establishment reads. I can't fathom that number considering it has (only) been open for 27 years. Maybe it's a joke? A misreading of the numbers? Do I misinterpret? Approx. 3 billion served a year? Absolutely no way - it should've been way more than that. This place states it has served our entire population 10 times over but considering the quality, price and lovability - it should've been 20x. This place has got me full with quality, handmade food for a price no one can really match. Go try anything. except the cookies. I didn't really like the cookies. But try anything else", "Positive"], ["The world famous Apple Cake I remember trying this almost a decade ago and I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It's still as good today, moist on the inside with some hints of crispy edges. So friggin good.

Whenever I have friends from abroad come visit and we're just a little bit hungover, I make sure to work Mystic Muffin into the conversation.A friend of mine recently moved into the Queen/Sherbourne area and I made sure to take her directly to Elias. The owner of MM, Elias, couldn't be more friendly. He works diligently and efficiently, but makes sure that you're well taken care of during your visit.Aside from the traditional breakfast fare, I'd definitely try the apple cake. Think of it as the Baked Apple Pie from McDonald's... but way better. It's usually hot and fresh, and has just the right combination of sweet, savoury, and tart. For $4, it can't be beat.Mystic Muffin is one of the best known places for breakfast in Toronto and for good reason. Great selection, great food, and most of all, great service. You can't go wrong paying Elias a visit next time you're in the Queen/Jarvis area!", "Positive"], ["SO HAPPY I FINALLY TRIED THIS TORONTO STAPLE. Their signature apple cake is a MUST.

Just had the sausage rolls and and spicy beef patty! Amazing!

Not only are they open but they are ready to serve!There is a lot more room to wait inside as they cleared away the tables and chairs to the corner. The store is still homey with lots of pastries, patties, and ready-to-make wraps at your service. The food is literally always, always fresh.The owner is the sweetest man ever. He's always ready to joke around and have a conversation with you.I bought half an apple cake today for $11 (full one is $20) and these things are massive!Definitely drop by if you're in the area", "Positive"], ["What can I say, I have a soft spot for mom and pop shops that provide good food at a fair price and Mystic Muffin is definitely it.Their platter, while possibly to carb heavy for some, is so flavourful, especially the potatoes and portions are very generous. I particularly recommend their eggplant, which, though it costs extra, is worth every penny.Though not pictured, I also indulged in Mystic's famous apple cake---a delicious treat that's got a bit of crunch up top but is perfectly moist everywhere else. So delicious I got half a pan of it ($11) to share at work and nobody could stop at just having a slice.I look forward to trying more menu items and knowing where I can go for delicious and fairly priced cakes for potlucks and gatherings!", "Positive"], ["The apple cake was delicious (I bought half the cake) :). \u00a0The banana bread with chocolate chips was also a 2 thumbs up and the sausage rolls were quite yummy as well.

I can eat it for any meal. It's the thing that gets me through fall, winter, also spring. It is perfect and my love for it is pure and unabashed. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way - this place is great! The soups seem super fresh, and as I was skimming the menu I kept thinking how great the ingredients pairings are in each one. When it came time to order, I decided on butternut squash with pear and fried shallots, and it was packed with flavor! The portion was huge as well - that bowl means business. And that biscuit that's served with it - gahhh, yes! For $10, I feel you definitely get a full meal. /10, would absolutely go back", "Positive"], ["Even though the namesake of this place is soups, my favorite thing here is their curry lamb wrap. The lamb is cooked and marinated really well in the curry, which has a slight kick to it as well.The pork shoulder wrap was okay, but the pork needed more seasoning. The pineapple salsa helped bring it to life a little, but even a little salt would go a long way. If you get this, I'd pair it with a soup that has a more robust flavor.I'm glad that they are downtown, but it still makes me sad to see that covid restrictions mean both the interior and patio are empty of people and liveliness", "Positive"], ["You can't go wrong with the wraps for lunch! I've tried two wraps here when I was super busy at work and didn't have time to make food. They have a lot of flavours you'll definitely find one you'll like!", "Positive"], ["This is a definite recommend place if you're in need of something warm on a cold day. Coming in, the cashier is very courteous and welcoming. The restaurant has a big spacious area inside if you want to dine in, or you can opt for the bar seats by the open window. They have a big selection of soups to choose from, and they offer combos with wraps/sandwiches. The food didn't take too long to arrive, roughly 10 mins. The portions were pretty big, which is great as the price of the combo was roughly $15. The mushroom soup had a very clean taste, and there was big chunks of mushrooms inside. It also had a hint \u00a0of truffle flavour which gave the soup a very fresh smell/flavour. Ravi's Stew is definitely perfect if you want something with a slight kick as the soul was very flavorful and packed vegetables. We got the combo with the butter chicken \u00a0wrap and wow, the wrap with stuffed which chicken. I was super full by the end, but I was very satisfied with what I ordered. Next time I'll probably get either the soup or wrap haha", "Positive"], ["This spot is so close to our condo. So we decided to check it out! And it did not disappoint. We ordered the chicken and pork shoulder wraps & Ravi soup. The flavour is so profound and they did not cheap out on the portion. I was happily stuffed. 10/10 coming back", "Positive"], ["Value for money is definitely there! It's the perfect spot for a cold winter day as they have amazing wraps and soups on offer. Today I got the chicken wrap, no soup thought as I thought it would be too much for a weekday lunch. My Roasted Free Range Chicken wrap had roasted yams, baby spinach, edamame, caramelized onions, tomato chutney & chipotle mayo. The combination of the yams with onions was delicious! I really liked the chicken too - it tasted fresh out of the oven. I didn't care too much for the edamame myself but it didn't take away from the overall dish. I ended up packing half of the wrap as I don't know how anyone would have had a full wrap. It's quite filling and very delish! :)", "Positive"], ["The worst soup and wraps that I've ever had in my life... omg... the most blend taste of butternut squash soup. zero flavor and you only taste coconut milk.. when they make wraps, they touch the ingredients with bare hands and they used the unwashed pans.. I understand having fruit flies but just regular flies are unacceptable.... (I don't usually leave reviews on yelp, actually it's my first and will be the last review.)", "Positive"], ["This place make some delicious soup!

The roasted yams and \u00a0caramelized onions inside the wrap combined with the Chipotle Mayo made it pretty sweet. I would love the option to add something a bit more crunchy in the wrap like carrots or red peppers.I initially decided to try out this place because I was feeling a bit under the weather and needed some soothing soup to help me fight the onset of a cold. The \u00a0RaviStew was exactly what I pictured when I ordered it and it did not disappoint. While it did taste like a homemade goat or chicken curry, I didn't mind because that was exactly what I needed. Head up, the RaviStew has some tumeric in it , so stains can easily occur! Overall it was a pretty good first visit, the service was fast & friendly, and the portion size was so generous!", "Positive"], ["I got the butternut squash soup and a roasted veggie wrap for a spontaneous lunch before a movie. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and they have free wifi which is always a nice commodity! They were very friendly when taking our order and the food was prepared quickly. The food itself was good, the soup was a little spicy from the pepper they used I think, but it was not unbearable as I enjoy spicy but it might catch others who don't like the extra spice off guard. The wrap was very large for the price and was loaded with lots of veggies. Would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again and craving a comforting soup!", "Positive"], ["I like it. They've got wraps, and they've got soups. Order them both as a combo and you save several couple dollars (though the soup is a bit smaller than the stand-alone offering).Wrap is flavorful, soups are hearty. The lamb wraps and chicken wraps were satisfying; not too small, but not too big.The Ravi Stew is just stuffed full of vegetables and chicken; very nice.Chicken hot pot soup was also really good", "Positive"], ["This is a review of their VIRTUAL MIXOLOGY event.What a treat! \u00a0So all the ingredients arrived a few days in advance of the event, very nicely packaged, recipe card including items needed for session.The mixologist (Hugh) was personable, very easy to follow and knowledgeable, provided right amount of time between steps and overall did a great job.The drinks we made were great and exotic enough but still approachable. Will definitely be using this for future team building sessions!Great job", "Positive"], ["Cocktail menu was cute. Feels dark, intimate, and lounge like. The crowd was good- no loud kids being sloppy . Seating in the couches is much better in my IMO. Drinks didn't disappoint, had the sesame ______. Recommend going early to get a spot as they appeared busy and full. On arrival, they seated us almost right away and realized they situated the wrong table. We had menus ready to order when they asked us to move back to the waiting area/outside. Pretty embarrassing to do that from all the way in the back. Once we were re-seated the manager came and compted us some this smokey thing with spoons which was appreciated but also lied about the situation to make it seem as it was a misunderstanding and didn't mean to make us move but there's no confusion when you tell us to go back to wait. \u200d Nonetheless if I lived in the area I'd take my friends there for craft cocktails", "Positive"], ["Probably one of the best cocktail bar experiences in the world. Toronto had some amazing places to visit, but for anyone who enjoys an experience, this is the place to be. A delightful and pricey experience with top notch service. They have small plates to share and all the bites are yummy. We ordered the Korean tofu, chicken Karaage and charred butter. For drinks we ordered - essence of fall, hickory Manhattan, pina colada, apricot. Totally worth it!", "Positive"], ["Always wanted to try this place as they had such beautiful drinks. They don't take reservations so you have to put yourself on a wait list the day of. PUT YOURSELF ON THE WAITLIST!! I cannot emphasize that enough. I had booked for a table of 4 and they said the wait would be for around 1.5 hr and we still waited for 2.5 hr and there were people that tried to walk in and got turned away. Be prepared to wait, thankfully there's lots to do and walk around in that area, so grab an ice cream or even dinner while u wait. Service: 5/5 Amazing staff. We were given the wrong table (table of 2 when we were a 4 top) and they were very apologetic even though it really wasn't a big deal because we were seated right away shortly after. The manager came to our table and gave us complimentary drinks for the mistake which was so so nice of her. We also got a lot or recommendations for drinks and their staff are really knowledgeable in terms of menu knowledge and what we would like. Drinks 5/5It was art. The drinks were so beautiful and presented in a way that made it seem like art. The server explained what she was doing the whole time and how we should drink it and what it would taste like. It was pretty amazing and i personally loved the pina colada a lot paired with the ice cream. A sweet and tropical taste to it paired with rum ice cream. It was an amazing cocktail and experience. Food: 6/5We got some snacks and honestly their fried chicken was so so amazing. Definitely will come back just for it. We also got popcorn, it had a special seasoning to it, wasnt sure what it was but it was really tasty. Overall 5/5 Would definitely recommend this place for the experience. Their pricing is on the more expensive side but it's 100 percent worth it to get the artistic drinks in my opinion. Would come back for the great service, beautiful drinks and not to mention, fried chicken", "Positive"], ["They are a first come first serve bar, but they use the Yelp wait list function which I always appreciate because you can join the line in advance and also be notified in real time. Loved the atmosphere here! Very intimate and made it feel like you were getting an exclusive experience. The staff was very welcoming without being overbearing.We sat at the bar and was able to watch the bar tenders in action.We ordered the Essence of Fall from their Modernist series, and it was truly a sensory experience. Highly recommend! Only thing was that where we were seated by the bar, it was very dark and therefore difficult to see the presentation of the drink. We had to use a phone flashlight discretely to see our drink", "Positive"], ["BEST PLACE I WENT TO IN TOR.

My boyfriend took me to BarChef during my recent Toronto visit after telling me about it for months! This small, dark, intimate cocktail bar looks more like an apothecary & serves fantastical cocktails!

Burger was delicious with provolone cheese, with a twist of gochujang Mayo, pickles, scrapchi sandwiches between a brioche bun, it was delicious and super filling even just with half a burger!Truffle gnudi - I don't usually like gnocchi type things, but this was really good! With local mushroom, portobello soil, walnut pesto and Parmesan chips Then we move on to the other main - artic char - with parsnip, brown butter apple slaw and sage chimichurri, perfectly seared fish \u00a0The dessert was amazing - pineapple upside down cake with a mascarpone semifreddo, ginger biscuit and pineapple curd.

Everything we got was 10/10.Cheers!", "Positive"], ["Amazing experience at Rasa!Went for a dinner date with a friend. I really enjoyed both the good and experience here. Not your typical Asian fusion rest. The flavours were so nicely curated in your mouth, we enjoyed every bite of every dish. Chopped salad, tuna tataki (must try) and the lemon thyme brownie- scrumptious. Really recommend this place , excellent ambiance and wonderful service. Great flours that we're so delightful", "Positive"], ["Absolutely incredible patio dining experience. The food was an incredible fusion of cuisines around the world. I truly enjoyed everything from the sticky ribs to the salad. This is a place you'd want to visit with a group so you can try a bit of everything from the menu! It is a tapas style restaurant so you'll want to order a couple of items per person. Even though our table was incredibly full, we still made room for their dessert which was the sticky bun. One of our friends has a severe nut allergy and the kitchen was very accommodating, modifying dishes to remove any nuts. Service was also great, the food came out one after the other so we weren't sitting around hungry. I definitely cannot wait to come back here and try the dishes that I wasn't able to the first time around", "Positive"], ["A resounding 5 stars, people. I don't even know where to start with Rasa, everything from reservations to ambiance, food, and service was beyond all expectations. This restaurant does absolutely everything right and I will explain why we loved it so much. Firstly reservations are booked online through Bookenda, super easy and quick. Not a lot available on a Tuesday night but we snagged an 8:15pm reservation. Once booked we got a confirmation email right from the restaurant and on the day of I got a text from a real person confirming the reservation. I was even able to ask about the menu via text and got a prompt, friendly response. Super cool and convenient!We arrived and were seated at almost exactly 8:15, our waiter showed up with some water right away and explained the menu to us. We opted for the classic tasting menu having never been there before, we wanted to sample their more well-known dishes. Our server was genuine, friendly, professional and funny throughout. Him and the rest of the servers were amazing and knowledgeable about each food item. Now for the food, everything we ate from the tapioca bun to the dessert was a complete 10/10. The flavours and textures were so incredible; complex, comforting, familiar, yet new and exotic all at the same time. I couldn't believe how good everything tasted. Portion sizes were perfect and my husband and I have bigger appetites. Everything was phenomenal but our highlights were the burger and the sticky bun for dessert. I can go on all day about each individual dish but I'd be writing a novel if I did that. The restaurant is kind of cozy, rustic, but cool and modern at the same time. It's casual and down to earth. These aren't cheap eats but the value is 100% spot on. The tasting menu is $65/person but I think it was well worth it, considering dining anywhere in Toronto will often cost around that if not more. I don't know why I waited so long to dine here but it's a new favorite for sure, I'll be recommending Rasa to all my friends and family because it's too good to miss. This is a true gem and all the good reviews are truly deserved. I have not a single negative thing to say about this establishment. Overall just a genuine, delicious experience that everyone has to try!", "Positive"], ["came here to celebrate my birthday. The cocktails are delicious, recommend passionfruit margarita. They are tapas style, the prices may make you think you are getting an entree size but they are meant for sharing and is small portion size. They were accommodating of dietary concern and try their best to work around it or offer you an alternative. The place is packed, very little spacing between tables. I was less than an arm length from the different group next to me, if you get up to use the washroom the other person has to move or you will be touching. it was too close and made everyone in our table and the other table uncomfortable. We ordered a number of items from the menu. Truffle gnudi, steak tartare and duck confit was our favourites. However after we got home we got a stomache, it might have been the tartare, the only person who didnt have the stomache did not have the tartare. I also do not recommend the ceviche, we had high hopes for it, but the fish did not taste right. We were told it's probably the seasoning, but something just was off. A week later, i tried a different restaurant and had their sea bream also saw and it definitely tasted better and not spoiled.- brussel sprouts $16- truffle gnudi $24 (there are 4 pieces of ghnochi)- spicy ceviche $18- steak tartare $28- duck confit $28- rasa burger $21", "Positive"], ["Menu is amazing and the staff are really nice. 5 stars", "Positive"], ["Came here for my birthday due to the alarmingly high stars and rave reviews (Yelp can be ruthless so this was a surprise) and was not disappointed. The great music, vibe and staff are truly want drives this place and make this establishment what it is. The staff is incredibly helpful when it comes to menu choices.So why did I dock one star? I made a reservation on OpenTable and only discovered on the day of my reservation that it was a Detroit location and that this was a known problem. Yikes. I happened to call ahead of time to let them know I was running late and was told they didn't have my name on the list. I got the feeling they would have accommodated us anyways if we did turn up because that is just the kind of people they are.I also called and left a voice message the night before asking to change my reservation time but no one got back to me. If someone did call me back we would have discovered well ahead of time that I didn't have a reservation, rather than 15 mins away from the restaurant after driving down 40 mins. Having said that, the food is great but the ceviche was a miss. Maybe it is just me but the peanut sauce was not a good mix. The chopped salad is the star of the show. The burger was great (it doesn't come with anything folks, just bun and patty so don't be looking for anything under the plates like us LOL) but the pasta was VERY salty. Got a dish with round items on it (I can't remember what it was) but it was also salty.I think my friends mentioned a few times it was my birthday. I had mentioned it too when I made the reservation. Not that I expect all restaurants to have a crew of singers, cake and confetti but a bit awkward when the table sat next to me was celebrating their birthday and my friends kept insisting \"shall we tell them again? shall we ...\" and I thought no! goodness no. Let's just go get dessert elsewhere. Verdict: I would come back but not for the food or if I was starving. I would come back for the vibe and the crowd", "Positive"], ["We went to Rasa for our four years anniversary and we were very lucky to be able to get a reservation at such a unique restaurant.

To start, we got an amazing chopped salad filled with chickpeas pepper, cheese and also an avocado rimmed bowl! \u00a0we also had a spicy ceviche appetizer to start too. \u00a0Both were unique, delicious and fresh! We were served a spicy pasta/Tteok-bokki with a korean fusion sauce . It was a little too spicy for me but it was too good to pass . Then we also had a fantastic duck lettuce wrap and it gave me a Chinese fusion feel. The duck was delicious too! Then, when we thought we were done, we got a Rasa Burger ! This burger was so juicy . Lastly, we finished off with a lemon thyme brownie! The thyme was super unique and the lemon was a great pairing with the brownie ! We also got two amazing cocktails. 10/10 would come back just for the drinks tbh!

The opportunity presented itself to try their food, and it does not disappoint. The banana pancakes are filled with roasted walnuts, toffee, whipped brown butter and real maple syrup. They come in a huge portion, which you most certainly won't be able to finish! The cinnamon bun pancakes are delicious as well, and a kid favourite. The Chai latte was a sweet addition to help complete the meal. They pay their staff a living wage, so the prices are higher than your typical brunch place.

It's important to keep supporting our local businesses, they need our love!", "Positive"], ["Love the fresh buttermilk biscuit- sometimes I go randomly just for it since I live around the area.

That should say it all.I finally had time to head down to Emma's this morning. Closed for many months at the start of the pandemic, I knew that they had to be hurting. Emma's has a takeout portal on their website so I had ordered 30 minutes in advance.Ready for some cinnamon biscuits to christen my new freezer at home and to later enjoy Christmas morning, I also ordered some of their plain buttermilk biscuits. Heck since I was there anyway, a side of their delicious coffee and side of pancakes were in order.Service was friendly and quick which was great because of my parking job out front. I realized that the pancakes would not be as delicious when I would eventually get home, so I reluctantly found a nearby street to eat my pancakes. As I opened the bag I realized that I forgot to ask for cutlery. Noooooo! So I looked around the car and found 1 wrapped (clean) Starbucks straw and some napkins. Flashing back to my childhood I decided to burrito my pancakes. I used the straw to butter my pancakes and poured a tiny bit of syrup on. So burrito-ing pancakes works well with brown sugar or jam, but it is a disaster with syrup. Merde! Miraculously I had a bottle of hand sanitizer in the car, so then my whole car smelled of vanilla and candy canes.Somehow my shirt and jacket emerged unscathed. Unfortunate the coffee wasn't well suited to drinking and driving on Dufferin. Thank goodness my jeans are black and my coffee not.I share my shame to encourage you to please go to Emma's and keep this gem in business. :)", "Positive"], ["Best about Emma's:- open Mondays !!!- bacon & sausage patties - gingerbread & cinnamon roll pancakes- REAL maple syrup- \u00a0homemade donuts- fabulous & friendly staff", "Positive"], ["One line to summarize my experience here - humble brunch done just right, delicious and hearty.I came here twice this year, one time with a larger group and another time only two of us. Tried two different items of them: first time was the Egg Benedict with peameal bacon, the second time was a stack of pancakes.Egg Benedict was done nicely: peameal bacon had crispy parts but not dry, muffin was of the right thickness, egg was runny and sauce were rich. Nothing was missing at all :DFor the pancake, I especially liked that they had ricotta cheese with lemon zest on top of pancake, it tasted refreshing and only with a subtle hint of sweetness. To me that was much better than piling up overly sweetened and fattened whipped cream which is more commonly seen for pancakes.Given the experience I can say this place scored points for both savory and sweet plates.Serving portions were generous - they kept me full for the entire morning and a half of the afternoon. Good for people with a large stomach. They also have a lot of side dish options that essentially can give you a mini version of their food - for instance, one Egg Benedict. Probably it's also fun to do some mix and match.One last note - this place gets very busy on weekends, and from what I recall they don't take reservations. So do be there early or you'll probably have to wait in the lineup", "Positive"], ["Haven't been here since pre-covid but I recommend their sage home made sausages and wild blueberry pancakes", "Positive"], ["Great place for drink and chat afterwork. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded at all. The inside was smaller than I thought, but nice that they have a patio.Apero was good, fries were so-so. Maybe will try their burger next time", "Positive"], ["The food and beer are good but service is so slow. Not enough servers I believe and makes you wait for long, on Friday night there's only one server running around avoiding eye contact", "Positive"], ["The beer bistro was very good for a drink and quick bite. We sat on the patio which is set up off the main street. It is very pretty with a cool, low key ambiance. They have a pretty extensive beer selection which was the major appeal of coming here. I got a pear cider which is a little different, but it was pretty tasty. For food, I ordered the pear and brie flat bread pizza. It wasn't anything to write home about, but pretty good for food. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the burger. It was juicy and flavorful. It was a standard burger and delicious. The fries were pretty good too. They were crispy, but some were a little overdone. Not as bad as I've seen at some places, but adds a bit of a bitter bite. Overall, I would absolutely check this place out for a late night drink and maybe something to share later in the evening", "Positive"], ["I'm going to start with the negatives first, one it is way overpriced and two the waiter needs more training or needs to be fired, he told me my payment didn't go through but when I checked it did, I didn't really appreciate it that, but anyways now the negatives are gone let's start with the positives I ordered the braised beef angliotti, didn't have to wait too long, it had spinach and the beef short rib was perfectly tender and meshed well with the pasta, that sauce was dynamite, I don't eat carbs so I consider this my cheat day, but the price was a bit too steep for the portion size they give and charging 30 bucks this is a complete rip off, that felt like a snack, but anyways quality over quantity it tasted really good just melts in your mouth, I won't really go ou to fly way to come here again cuz it's far but anyone who loves meat here definitely come check it out", "Positive"], ["The service is good , location is convenient and the tables are well spaced. Food is only ok though, good beer selection but not a standout downtown", "Positive"], ["Great late night bar with good late night food. The bartenders are very attentive. I got a set of flights of their local beer, which was very good", "Positive"], ["I came to Beerbistro for dinner with a group of friends after work. We made a reservation for 8+ people and they accommodated us well. Started off with the fondue as an appetizer. The waitress said it feeds 2-4 which I think is pretty accurate depending on how much people eat. The cheese was flavorful and smooth, and included a good mix of different cheeses (not sure which ones though). The bread was dry but okay to eat when drowned in cheese and I think they give you free refills. For the main, I had the hog wild flatbread. The pizza dough was chewy and grilled well, but the bbq sauce was a bit too sweet for me. The confit whole garlic pieces were the highlight of the flatbread. My friend ordered the beef curry which was delicious.Beerbistro has a huge selection of beer (duh) and some local beers that are worth trying. Overall I had a fun dinner and would recommend for a casual meal with good company!", "Positive"], ["It has been seven years since my first review of Beer Bistro so an update review is a 'must.' There have been subsequent visits since then. Somewhere within the seven years, I've even had a birthday dinner here.Firstly, the location is great. The restaurant is literally steps away from King Station and a few blocks from Union. It's a great meeting point that's easy to find. There are also a lot of post-dinner coffee spots around here, including a Starbucks by the station, Shy Coffee, and Marche down the street. Secondly, the service is consistently good. At the table, they are very attentive and seem to know the food menu well. They are also very knowledgeable about beer. I came here with a friend visiting from out of town and she was recommended a lovely beer based on her tastes. Thirdly (and most importantly), the food is quite good. If at Beer Bistro, ordering mussels are a must! They have a flavor for every palette. I also recommend an order of the fries - they are perfectly crispy.Good for: beer, mussels, frites, after work drinks", "Positive"], ["Tried Beerbistro and good say not so bad. Some good bar food. Ordered some mussels which were very yummy with there sauce which you can take off all the mussels and make it a mussel soup delicious. They got a bunch of beers on tap and bottle not really a beer guy but they had a nice variety. See you next time", "Positive"], ["Found this place after browsing a bit on Yelp, trying to find a late night place nearby to grab a drink. I was immediately drawn to Beerbistro because of their large selection on their draught list. And the option to get a flight for only $7! We were interested in trying some of the local/Canadian beers, so it was great that they had the flight option. They have 3 special drinks they they call \"The Taps of the Moment\", which are \"single keg offerings of specific styles\". As per their website, they had:1 THE BEER OF THE MOMENT2 THE FOUNDERS BREWING ROTATIONAL TAP3 ONTARIO CIDER OF THE MOMENTWe also got the drunchies so obviously got an order of Belgian frites ($7) with smoked tomato ketchup and house made mayo sauce. My god, it went SO well with the beers. And it was sizeable!! I love my fries, but I'm glad I shared it. They had a chill atmosphere, with tvs situated around the bar and restaurant, so I'm sure this is a great place to gather to watch games. I could even see myself coming here to get a drink and do work in the corner, at one of the high tops. I'm still uncertain about the \"Late Night\" menu that is on their website. We arrived about an hour or two before closing, but they gave us the normal food menu when I asked about the late night menu - not sure if that's still a thing. I'd come back for the drinks and fries, but not sure about their actual food menu, as it is pricier than I'd be willing to spend", "Positive"]]
